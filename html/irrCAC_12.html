<h2>Rating Data from 4 Raters and 12 Subjects.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains data from a reliability experiment where 5 observers scored 15 units on a 4-point numeric scale 
based on the values 0, 1, 2 and 3.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cac.raw4raters
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This dataset contains ratings obtained from an experiment where 4 raters classified 12 subjects into 5 
possible categories labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. None of the 4 raters scored all 12 units. Therefore, 
some missing ratings in the form of "NA" appear in each of the columns associated with the 4 raters.
</p>
<p>Note that only the the 4 last columns are to be used with the functions included in this package.  The first 
column only plays a descriptive role and is not used in any calculation.
