<h2>Specify Time Variables</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used in the model statement of idove() to specify
the entry time, left interval time, right interval time, and vaccination 
time.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">intCens(entry_time, left_time, right_time, vaccination_time)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>entry_time</code></td>
<td>
<p>The variable for the time when 
the participant enters the trial. Entry times must be integer
(or be able to be cast as integer without loss of information),
non-negative, and complete.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>left_time</code></td>
<td>
<p>The variable for the last examination time when
the test is negative. Left interval times must be integer
(or be able to be cast as integer without loss of information),
non-negative, and complete.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>right_time</code></td>
<td>
<p>The variable for the first examination time when
the test is positive. Right interval times must be integer
(or be able to be cast as integer without loss of information),
non-negative, and NA or Inf should be used if the participant never 
tested positive during the trial.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vaccination_time</code></td>
<td>
<p>The variable for the time when 
vaccination takes place. Vaccination times must be integer
(or be able to be cast as integer without loss of information),
non-negative, and NA or Inf should be used if the participant was not 
vaccinated during the trial.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Times must obey the following relationships:
(i) For all participants, entry_time &lt;= left_time;
(ii) For all participants that tested positive during the trial,
entry_time &lt;= left_time &lt;= right_time; and 
(iii) For all participants that received vaccination,
entry_time &lt;= vaccination_time. If a case is found to violate one or more
of these relationships, its entry_time is set to NA.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function is intended to be used only in the model statement 
of idove(). The result, a matrix, is used internally.
