<h2>Iterative Proportional Updating (Newton-Raphson)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>List balancing similar to <code>ipu</code>, but using the
Newton-Raphson approach to optimization. Created primarily as a point of
comparison for <code>ipu</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ipu_nr(
  primary_seed,
  primary_targets,
  secondary_seed = NULL,
  secondary_targets = NULL,
  target_priority = 1e+07,
  relative_gap = 0.01,
  max_iterations = 100,
  absolute_diff = 10,
  weight_floor = 1e-05,
  verbose = FALSE,
  max_ratio = 10000,
  min_ratio = 1e-04
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>primary_seed</code></td>
<td>
<p>In population synthesis or household survey expansion, 
this would be the household seed table (each record would represent a 
household). It could also be a trip table, where each row represents an 
origin-destination pair. Must contain a <code>pid</code> ("primary ID") field
that is unique for each row. Must also contain a geography field that
starts with "geo_".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>primary_targets</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>named list</code> of data frames.  Each name in the 
list defines a marginal dimension and must match a column from the 
<code>primary_seed</code> table. The data frame associated with each named list
element must contain a geography field (starts with "geo_"). Each row in
the target table defines a new geography (these could be TAZs, tracts,
clusters, etc.). The other column names define the marginal categories that
targets are provided for. The vignette provides more detail.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>secondary_seed</code></td>
<td>
<p>Most commonly, if the primary_seed describes households, the 
secondary seed table would describe a unique person with each row. Must
also contain the <code>pid</code> column that links each person to their 
respective household in <code>primary_seed</code>. Must not contain any geography
fields (starting with "geo_").</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>secondary_targets</code></td>
<td>
<p>Same format as <code>primary_targets</code>, but they constrain 
the <code>secondary_seed</code> table.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>target_priority</code></td>
<td>
<p>This argument controls how quickly each set of 
targets is relaxed. In other words: how important it is to match the target
exactly. Defaults to <code>10,000,000</code>, which means that all targets should
be matched exactly.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>real</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This priority value will be used for each target table.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>named list</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Each named entry must match an entry in either
<code>primary_targets</code> or <code>secondary_targets</code> and have a <code>real</code>.
This priority will be applied to that target table. Any targets not in the
list will default to <code>10,000,000</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>data.frame</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Column <code>target</code> must have values that match an
entry in either <code>primary_targets</code> or <code>secondary_targets</code>. Column 
<code>priority</code> contains the values to use for priority. Any targets not in
the table will default to <code>10,000,000</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>relative_gap</code></td>
<td>
<p>After each iteration, the weights are compared to the
previous weights and the 
the <code>relative_gap</code> threshold, then the process terminates.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_iterations</code></td>
<td>
<p>maximum number of iterations to perform, even if 
<code>relative_gap</code> is not reached.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>absolute_diff</code></td>
<td>
<p>Upon completion, the <code>ipu()</code> function will report
the worst-performing marginal category and geography based on the percent
difference from the target. <code>absolute_diff</code> is a threshold below which
percent differences don't matter.
</p>
<p>For example, if if a target value was 2, and the expanded weights equaled
1, that's a 100
is only 1.
</p>
<p>Defaults to 10.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weight_floor</code></td>
<td>
<p>Minimum weight to allow in any cell to prevent zero
weights. Set to .0001 by default.  Should be arbitrarily small compared to
your seed table weights.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>Print iteration details and worst marginal stats upon 
completion? Default <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_ratio</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>real</code> number. The average weight per seed record is
calculated by dividing the total of the targets by the number of records.
The max_scale caps the maximum weight at a multiple of that average. Defaults
to <code>10000</code> (basically turned off).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min_ratio</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>real</code> number. The average weight per seed record is
calculated by dividing the total of the targets by the number of records.
The min_scale caps the minimum weight at a multiple of that average. Defaults
to <code>0.0001</code> (basically turned off).</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a <code>named list</code> with the <code>primary_seed</code> with weight, a 
histogram of the weight distribution, and two comparison tables to aid in
reporting.
