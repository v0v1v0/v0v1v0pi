<h2>Downloads and installs a ZIP R package Binary (for Windows) from a URL</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Gets a character with a link to an R package Binary, downloads it, and installs it.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">install.packages.zip(zip_URL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>zip_URL</code></td>
<td>
<p>a link to a ZIP R package Binary.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To my knowledge, there is currently three ways to install packages on R:
1. To get the package through a repository (such as CRAN or RForge) through install.packages.
2. To manually download a ZIP file locally to the computer, and use install.packages on it.
3. To get the package from github, by using devtools (but this will require you to first install RTools, and not everyone wishes to do it for just some package).
This function aims to combine option 1 and 2, by automatically downloading the ZIP file locally and then running install.packages on it. After being downloaded and installed, the binary is erased from the computer.
