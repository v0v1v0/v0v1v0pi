<h2>Simulated Dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The dataset consists of <code class="reqn">N = 240</code> individuals and <code class="reqn">R =
  4</code> data views with different data types. Two of the data views are
continuous, one is count, and one is binary. The <em>true</em> number of
clusters was set to <code class="reqn">K = 4</code>, and the cluster proportions were set at <code class="reqn">\pi_1
  = 0.25, \pi_2 = 0.25, \pi_3 = 0.25, \pi_4 = 0.25</code>, such that we have
balanced cluster proportions. Each of the data views had <code class="reqn">p_r = 500</code>
features, <code class="reqn">r = 1, \dots, 4</code>, but only 50, or 10%, were relevant
features that contributed to the clustering, and the rest were noise
features that did not contribute to the clustering. In total, there were
<code class="reqn">p = \sum_{r=1}^4 = 2000</code> features.
</p>
<p>For data view 1 (continuous), relevant features were generated from the
following normal distributions: <code class="reqn">\text{N}(10, 1)</code> for Cluster 1,
<code class="reqn">\text{N}(5, 1)</code> for Cluster 2, <code class="reqn">\text{N}(-5, 1)</code> for Cluster 3,
and <code class="reqn">\text{N}(-10, 1)</code> for Cluster 4, while noise features were
generated from <code class="reqn">\text{N}(0, 1)</code>. For data view 2 (continuous), relevant
features were generated from the following normal distributions:
<code class="reqn">\text{N}(-10, 1)</code> for Cluster 1,    <code class="reqn">\text{N}(-5, 1)</code> for Cluster
2, <code class="reqn">\text{N}(5, 1)</code> for Cluster 3, and <code class="reqn">\text{N}(10, 1)</code> for
Cluster 4, while noise features were generated from <code class="reqn">\text{N}(0, 1)</code>.
For data view 3 (binary), relevant features were generated from the
following Bernoulli distributions: <code class="reqn">\text{Bernoulli}(0.05)</code> for Cluster
1,    <code class="reqn">\text{Bernoulli}(0.2)</code> for Cluster 2,
<code class="reqn">\text{Bernoulli}(0.4)</code> for Cluster 3, and <code class="reqn">\text{Bernoulli}(0.6)</code>
for Cluster 4, while noise features were generated from
<code class="reqn">\text{Bernoulli}(0.1)</code>. For data view 4 (count), relevant features
were generated from the following Poisson distributions:
<code class="reqn">\text{Poisson}(50)</code> for Cluster 1, <code class="reqn">\text{Poisson}(35)</code> for
Cluster 2, <code class="reqn">\text{Poisson}(20)</code> for Cluster 3, and
<code class="reqn">\text{Poisson}(10)</code> for Cluster 4, while noise features were generated
from <code class="reqn">\text{Poisson}(2)</code>.
