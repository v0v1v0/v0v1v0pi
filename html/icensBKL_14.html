<h2>Data on Mastitis in Dairy Cattle</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mastitis in dairy cattle is the inflammation of the udder and the most
important disease in the dairy sector of the western world. Mastitis
reduces the milk production and the quality of the milk. For this
mastitis study, 100 cows were included into the study from the time of parturition (assumed to be free of infection). They were screened
monthly at the udder-quarter level for bacterial infections. Since the
udder quarters are separated, one quarter might be infected while other
quarters remain free of infection. The cows were  followed up until the
end of the lactation period, which lasted approximately 300 to 350
days. Some cows were lost to follow-up, due to, e.g. culling. Because of
the approximately monthly follow-up (except during July/August for which
only one visit was planned due to lack of personnel), data are interval
censored. Right censored data are present when no infection occurred
before the end of the lactation period or the lost to follow up time. As visits were planned independently of infection times, independent noninformative censoring is a valid assumption.
</p>
<p>Two covariates were recorded. The first is the number of calvings, i.e.,
parity. This is a categorical cow-level covariate with the following
categories: (1) one calving, (2) 2 to 4 calvings and (3) more than 4
calvings and is also represented by two dummy variables (representing classes
2 and 3). The second covariate is the position of the udder quarter
(front or rear). Both variables have been suggested in the literature to
impact the incidence of mastitis (Weller et al., 1992; Adkinson et al., 1993).
