<h2>MRMC analysis for arbitrary design dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Execute a Multi-Reader, Multi-Case (MRMC) analysis
of ROC data from imaging studies where clinicians (readers) evaluate patient
images (cases). This function is a wrapper that executes 
<code>doAUCmrmc</code> and formats the output to generally match the output of 
<code>doIMRMC</code> version 1.2.5.
An overview of this software, including references presenting
details on the methods, can be found <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/8383591">HERE</a>
or as an entry in the FDA/CDRH Regulatory Science Tool Catalog

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">doIMRMC(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>

<p>an iMRMC formatted data frame, see dfMRMC_example</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Unlike the legacy <code>doIMRMC_java</code>, the 'varDecomp' results no 
longer scale the covariance by a factor of 2. This scaling is needed when 
calculating the total variance of the difference in modalities. The user 
must scale this covariance by 2 manually now to achieve the total variance
of the difference in modalities result.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The MRMC analysis results, below is a quick summary:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>perReader, data.frame</code> 
The performance results for each combination of reader and pair of modalities.
Key variables of this data frame are AUCA, AUCB, AUCAminusAUCB
and the corresponding variances.
When the modalities differ, the variance is understood to be the covariance between the modalities.

</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Ustat, data.frame</code>
Reader-averaged performance results for each pair of modalities.
The analysis results are based on U-statistics.
Key variables of this data frame are AUCA, AUCB, 
AUCAminusAUCB and the corresponding variances, 
confidence intervals, degrees of freedom, and p-values.
When the modalities differ, the variance is understood to be the covariance between the modalities.

</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>MLEstat, data.frame</code>
Reader-average performance results for each pair of modalities.
The analysis results are based on V-statistics, which 
approximates the true distribution with
the empirical distribution. The empirical distribution equals 
the nonparametric MLE
estimate of the true distribution, which is also equivalent 
to the ideal bootstrap estimate.
Key variables of this data frame are AUCA, AUCB, 
AUCAminusAUCB and the corresponding
variances, confidence intervals, degrees of freedom, and p-values.
When the modalities differ, the variance is understood to be the covariance between the modalities.

</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>varDecomp, list</code>
list of data frames of the coefficient and components of 
variance. The analysis includes variance decomposition based off both the 
BDG and BCK MRMC methods, and Ustat and MLE statistical methods. 
Each MRMC and statistical method combination is contained within this 
list of lists. 

</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ROC, list</code>
each object of this list is an object containing an ROC curve.
There is an ROC curve for every combination of reader and modality.
For every modality, there are also four average ROC curves. 
These are discussed in Chen2014_Br-J-Radiol_v87p20140016.
The diagonal average averages the reader-specific ROC curves 
along y = -x + b for b in (0,1).
The horizontal average averages the reader specific ROC curves 
along y = b for b in (0,1).
The vertical average averages the reader specific ROC curves 
along x = b for b in (0,1).
The pooled average ignores readerID and pools all the scores 
together to create one ROC curve.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>full, list</code>
This returns the same result as <code>doAUCmrmc</code>.

</p>
</li>
</ul>
