<h2>Fit the calibration model (or load parameters from calibration done outside
IsoriX)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function establishes the relationship between the isotopic values of
organisms (e.g. tissues such as hair, horn, ivory or feathers; referred in
code as <em>sample_value</em>) and the isotopic values of their environment (e.g.
precipitation water; referred in code as <em>source_value</em>). This function is
only needed when the assignment of organisms has to be performed within an
isoscape that was not built using the organisms themselves, but that was
instead built using another source of isotopic values (e.g., precipitation).
If the isoscape had been fitted using isotopic ratios from sedentary animals
directly, this calibration step is not needed (e.g. isoscape fitted using
sedentary butterflies and migratory butterflies to assign). In other cases,
this calibration step is usually needed since organisms may not directly
reflect the isotopic values of their environment. Depending on the
calibration data to be used (provided via the argument <code>data</code>), one of four
possible calibration methods must be selected (via the argument <code>method</code>).
Each method considers a different statistical model and requires particular
data that are organised in a specific way (see <strong>Details</strong> for explanations
and <strong>Examples</strong> for use cases).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>method</code> argument can take one of the four values "wild" (default),
"lab", "desk" and "desk_inverse" corresponding to the four calibration
methods. It is crucial for you to select the method that is most appropriate
for your workflow, as the choice of method can impact the most likely
assignment locations during the assignment test performed in
<code>isofind</code>.
</p>


<h4>Method "wild"</h4>

<p>This calibration method is the one to be used when the calibration data to be
used correspond to isotopic values measured on sedentary organisms and when
no direct measurement of isotopic values in the environment are available at
the locations where sedentary organisms have been collected. In such a case,
the isotopic values in the environment of sedentary organisms are predicted
internally using an isoscape fitted with <code>isofit</code>. This calibration method
thus aims at estimating and accounting for the uncertainty associated with
these predicted values. Such uncertainty is accounted for when fitting the
calibration fit so as to produce an unbiased estimation of the calibration
relationship and it is also then accounted for by <code>isofind</code> when inferring
the possible locations of origin. Before we added the argument <code>method</code> in
calibfit (i.e. before releasing the version 0.8.3), this method was the only
one available in IsoriX.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>Statistical model</strong>: in this case, the calibration model to be fitted is
a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) that fits the isotopic values of sedentary
organisms as a linear function of the isotopic values in their environment
(e.g. precipitation). The function considers that the isotopic values from
the environment (e.g. from precipitation) at the locations at which organisms
were sampled are not known. The function therefore predicts these isotopic
values from the geostatistical model fitted by the function <code>isofit</code>, which
is provided to calibfit using the argument <code>isofit</code>. The LMM used to fit the
calibration function has a simple fixed-effect structure: an intercept and a
slope. The random effect is more complex: it is normally distributed with
mean zero, a certain variance between locations proportional to the squared
(fixed) slope, and a covariance structure defined by the prediction
covariance matrix of the isoscape model between the calibration locations.
See appendix in Courtiol et al. 2019 for more details.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Required calibration data</strong>: the calibration data to be used here must be
a dataframe (or a tibble) containing at least the following columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>sample_value</code>: the isotopic value of the calibration sample
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>long</code>: the longitude coordinate (decimal degrees)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>lat</code>: the latitude coordinate (decimal degrees)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>site_ID</code>: the sample site
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The column name must be identical to those indicated here. Other columns
can be present in the data but won't be used. Each row must correspond to
a different calibration sample (i.e. a single isotopic measurement). See
<code>CalibDataAlien</code>, <code>CalibDataBat</code>, or
<code>CalibDataBat2</code> for examples of such a dataset.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Method "lab"</h4>

<p>This calibration method is the one to be used when the calibration data to be
used correspond to isotopic values recorded for both organisms and their
environment. We can foresee three main situations in which the "lab" method
is the one to be used:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> the data are generated by growing organisms in a controlled
environment where they are fed and/or given water with a specific (known)
isotopic value.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> sedentary organisms are sampled in the wild together with a sample
from their environment and that isotopic values have been measured for
both.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> you want to use a calibration made by others based on a plot of that
calibration showing the datapoints. In such a case, you should use an R
package (e.g. metaDigitse or digitize) or software (e.g. graphClick or
dataThief) to extract the coordinates on the plots so as to obtain the
isotopic values of the sample and the environment behind each point.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the use cases 1 and 2 will allow for the propagation of all
relevant sources of uncertainty during the assignment. In contrast, the third
use case implies to neglect uncertainty in the isotopic values in the
environment if those were initially predicted using an isoscape. It also
neglects the covariances involving such predicted values. That being said, if
you want to use someone else calibration relationship, using this method is
generally preferable to using the method "desk" described below (less error
prone and de facto accounting for all five parameters mentioned for the
method "desk").
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>Statistical model</strong>: in this case, the calibration model to be fitted is
a simple linear model (LM) or a simple linear mixed-effects model (LMM) that
fits the isotopic values of sedentary organisms as a linear function of the
isotopic values in their environment (e.g. precipitation). Whether it is a LM
or a LMM depends on the presence of a column <code>site_ID</code> in the dataset as
well as on the number of unique values for such a column. If the column is
present and the number of unique values is larger than 4, a LMM is fitted.
Otherwise, a LM is fitted. In both cases, the function considers that the
isotopic values from the environment (e.g. from precipitation) at the
locations at which organisms were sampled are known. Contrary to the method
"wild", the environment values are thus considered as observed and not
predicted from an isoscape. The argument <code>isofit</code> should thus remain
<code>NULL</code> in this case (since no isoscape is used, no isoscape fit is
required to perform the calibration). The model used to fit the calibration
function has a simple fixed effect structure: an intercept and a slope.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Required calibration data</strong>: the calibration data to be used here must be
a dataframe (or a tibble) containing at least the following columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>sample_value</code>: the isotopic value of the calibration sample
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>source_value</code>: the isotopic value of the environment
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>site_ID</code> (optional): the sample site
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The column name must be identical to those indicated here. Other columns
can be present in the data but won't be used. Each row must correspond to
a different calibration sample (i.e. a single sample-environment pair of
isotopic measurements).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Methods "desk" and "desk_inverse"</h4>

<p>These calibration methods must only be used as a last resource! They are
unlikely to yield robust inference during the assignment step. These
calibration methods are the ones to be used when no calibration data is
directly available, when you cannot either extract the data from a plot, and
thus when you must rely solely on published metrics (including intercept and
slope) to represent a calibration relationship. They work by making crude
assumptions that various uncertainty components are null.
</p>
<p>The method "desk" is the one to be used when the published calibration
relationship is of the form <code>lm(sample_value ~ source_value)</code> and the
method "desk_inverse" is the one to be used when the published calibration
relationship is of the form <code>lm(source_value ~ sample_value)</code>. Do make
sure you are using the correct alternative. Note that the model used for the
published calibration must be a linear regression (LM) and not a reduced
major axis regression (RMA). If you use parameter values stemming from a RMA,
the assignment will most likely be biased.
</p>
<p>Both methods require five metrics to work at their best: the intercept and
slope of a calibration relationship, the standard errors (SE) associated to
them, and the residual variance (not SD). For statistical reasons, the method
"desk" is more flexible than the method "desk_inverse" and can still work (in
the sense of running, but the reliability of the assignments will get worse)
if the SEs and/or the residual variance is not provided. For the method
"desk_inverse" all metrics are unfortunately necessary.
</p>
<p>Don't expect miracles: even if the "desk" method is used together with its
five parameters, the assignment will still suffer from the same limitations
as those impacting the method "lab" usage number 3. If less than five
parameters are provided, further assumptions are made and this comes with a
cost: again, it can bias the assignment and bias the confidence region. For
these reasons, we were tempted to use <code>method = "dirty"</code> instead of
<code>method = "desk"</code>... but we chickened out since we predicted that users
would then refrain from mentioning the method they used in publications...
</p>
<p>Note that if the provided slope is set to 0 and an intercept is considered,
the calibration methods actually corresponds to the simple consideration of a
fractionation factor.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><strong>Statistical model</strong>: none!
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Required calibration data</strong> for method "desk": the calibration data to be
used here must be a dataframe (or a tibble) containing a single row with the

</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>slope</code>: the estimated slope of a LM calibration fit
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>intercept_se</code> (optional): the standard error around the intercept
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>slope_se</code> (optional): the standard error around the slope
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>resid_var</code> (optional): the residual variance (not SD) of a LM
calibration fit
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Required calibration data</strong> for method "desk_inverse": the calibration
data to be used here must be a dataframe (or a tibble) containing a single

</p>

<ul>

</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>slope</code>: the estimated slope of a LM calibration fit
</p>

</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>resid_var</code>: the residual variance (not SD) of a LM calibration fit
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>sign_mean_Y</code>: a <em>numeric</em> indicating the sign of the mean
value of the isotopes in the environment in the format returned by <code>sign</code>;
that is either <code>1</code> (if positive) or <code>-1</code> (if negative). This is
required for pivoting the regression from "desk_inverse" to "desk".
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>N</code>: a  <em>numeric</em> indicating the sample size of the data used
for the calibration fit. This is required for pivoting the regression from
"desk_inverse" to "desk".
