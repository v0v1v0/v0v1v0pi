<h2>Parameter Information</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Parameter information for selected chemical constituents,
organic compounds, and radionuclides measured for in water samples collected from
monitoring sites in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) water-quality monitoring network,
Idaho National Laboratory and vicinity, Idaho.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">parameters
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>pcode</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>USGS 5-digit parameter code.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>parm_group_nm</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Parameter group name.
Abbreviations and descriptions are as follows:
"Information" includes information about the water sample such as
the date and time of collection, the location of the sample, and the method of analysis used;
"Inorganics, Major, Metals" includes major inorganic ions and metals,
"Inorganics, Major, Non-metals" includes major inorganic non-metallic ions;
"Inorganics, Minor, Metals" includes minor inorganic metallic ions;
"Inorganics, Minor, Non-metals" includes minor inorganic non-metallic ions;
"Nutrient" includes nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus that can be present in water samples;
"Organics, Other" includes organic compounds that are not classified as pesticides or PCBs;
"Organics, Pesticide" includes organic compounds that are used as pesticides,
such as insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides;
"Physical" includes physical characteristics of water;
"Radiochemical" includes radioactive isotopes that can be present in water samples; and
"Stable Isotopes" includes non-radioactive isotopes of elements that can be
used to trace the movement of water through the hydrologic cycle.</p>
