<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The simulation algorithm uses a finite differencing scheme with backwards
differencing. The model used for simulation is a reaction diffusion-advection
equation in which the advection term is variable in space but diffusion and
reactions are constant in space see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection%E2%80%93diffusion_equation">convection-diffusion
equation</a> for an example.
</p>
<p>The parameters used in the general partial differntial equation in the link
above are
</p>
<p>D = 0.01 per squared spatial unit
</p>
<p>R = 0.5 per unit time
</p>
<p>v (advection is variable in space): in the upper left quadrant of the square
domain v = (0.2, 0); in the upper right quadrant v = (0, -0.2); in the lower
right quadrant v = (-0.2, 0); in the lower right quadrant v = (0, 0.2).
Obviously v is discontinous at the quadrant boundaries, which causes some
interesting model behaviour that is limited by considering only the first six
time steps such that the bulk of the concentration in each quadrant does not
cross a quadrant boundary.
</p>
<p>The intial condition at time = 0 is a concentration of one unit per arbitrary
unit of volume in the central cell of each quadrant.
</p>
<p>External boundary conditions are zero-gradient (reflecting).
</p>
<p>The data are formatted such that they can easily be converted to a raster
stack using ICvectorfields::RastStackData(SimData).
