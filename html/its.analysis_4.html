<h2>Post-estimating ITSA models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to produce post-estimation plots from the itsa.model function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">itsa.postest(
  model = NULL,
  no.plots = FALSE,
  alpha = 0.05,
  bootstrap = TRUE,
  print = TRUE
)
</code></pre>

<td>
<p>define ITSA model results object.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>no.plots</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, specify whether function should present post-estimation plots (default is FALSE).</p>
</td>

<td>
<p>define alpha level for test statistics, default is 0.05.</p>
</td>

<p>logical, specify whether the main model result should be printed to the console.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function runs and reports post-estimation tests on fits from the itsa.model function, and generates four plots.
</p>
<p>Main tests are whether two key ANCOVA assumptions are met, and an additional autocorrelation test for the time series framework.
</p>
<p>The Shapiro-Wilks test examines the residuals from the fitted model for abnormality. A p-value less than alpha indicates abnormal residuals. In this instance, the user should consider replicating the its.analysis model design using a non-parametric ANCOVA equivalent.
</p>
<p>The Levene's Test makes sure that there are equal variances between the treated groups. A p-value less than alpha indicates heterogeneous variances.
</p>
<p>A QQ-Norm and Boxplot are generated with the test results overlaid (respectively), with a Residual v Fitted and Autocorrelation Function Plot also generated.
</p>
<p>The results of bootstrap estimations in itsa.model will be plotted, unless argument is switched to FALSE. See plot.boot help file for assistance on interpreting these plots.
</p>
<p>Default is to generate plots and summary table, but plots may be overridden using no.plots argument.
</p>
<p>Default alpha value for post-estimation statistics is 0.05, test results will suggest potential presence of problems at higher values (and also at higher levels relative to a user-defined alpha), but user discretion is needed (examined in tandem with the Residuals v Fitted plot).
</p>
<p>See 'itsa.model' documentation for further information.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a list containing post-estimation test results and four plots (plus one additional if bootstrapping applied) which are also sent directly to the plot tab.
