Data for greater horseshoe bats from Switzerland, 1989-2017
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data for greater horseshoe bats (<em>Rhinolophus ferrumequinum</em>) were collected from 1989 to 2017 from a nursery colony in a church in the Swiss Alps (Valais).
</p>
<p>Bats were captured and marked resulting in capture-recapture data, but in some years no capture was performed. Every year the number of adults was counted when they leave the colony at dusk and the number of newborn was recorded in the colony.
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>bats</code> is a list with 7 components:

</dd>
<dt>age </dt>
<dd>
<p>the age of each bat at first capture, 1 = juvenile, 2 = 1-year old, 3 = at least 2 years old.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sex </dt>
<dd>
<p>sex of bats captured, 1 = female, 2 = male.</p>
</dd>
<dt>J.count </dt>
<dd>

<dd>
<p>number of newborn bats recorded as female.</p>
</dd>
<dt>A.count </dt>
