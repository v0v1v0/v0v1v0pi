<h2>
Data for barn swallows in Switzerland, 1997-2003
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Demographic data of barn swallows (<em>Hirundo rustica</em>) were collected from nine sites in Switzerland that were between 19 and 224 km apart from 1997 to 2003.
</p>
<p>Each year the number of breeding pairs and detailed information about productivity from regular checks of the nests were recorded. Nestlings were ringed and adults captured, resulting in capture-recapture data. Not all sites were surveyed every year, resulting in NAs in the data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(swallow)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>swallow</code> is a list with 5 components:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>marr.j </dt>
<dd>
<p>an array with capture-recapture data for juvenile females in m-array format, sites x release year x recapture year.</p>
</dd>
<dt>marr.a </dt>
<dd>
<p>an array with capture-recapture data for adult females in m-array format, sites x release year x recapture year.</p>
</dd>
<dt>counts </dt>
<dd>
<p>a matrix with annual number of breeding pairs observed at each site, sites x years.</p>
</dd>
<dt>productivity </dt>
<dd>
<p>an array with productivity variables for monitored broods, brood type (first or second) x sites x years x variable; the variables are total number of eggs and fledglings in monitored broods and the number of broods monitored.</p>
</dd>
<dt>second </dt>
<dd>
<p>an array with the number of first broods and second broods observed, sites x years x brood type.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
