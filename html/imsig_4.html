<h2>Feature selection of signature genes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>ImSig genes were designed to be co-expressed in tissue transcriptomic data. However, depending on the dataset some of the genes may not co-express with the dominant module. In order to remove such deviant genes, a feature selection can be carried out based on correlation. This function removes genes that exhibit a poor correlation (less than the defined r value) with the dominant ImSig module. This step of feature selection is recommended to enrich the prediction of relative abundance of immune cells.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">feature_select(exp, r = 0.6)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>exp</code></td>
<td>
<p>Dataframe of transcriptomic data (natural scale) containing genes as rows and samples as columns. Note: Gene names should be set as row names and duplicates are not allowed. Missing values are not allowed within the expression matrix. Check example- head(example_data): <code>example_data</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>r</code></td>
<td>
<p>Use a value between 0 and 1. Default is 0.6. This is a user defined correlation cut-off to perform feature selection. To get an idea of what cut-off to use check the results of (<code>gene_stat</code>) and choose a cut-off that displays high median correlation and maintains a high proportion of genes after feature selection.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a list of 'feature selected' genes based on the set r value.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">feature_select (exp = example_data, r = 0.7)
</code></pre>
