<dt>InvaCost_ID</dt>
<dd>
<p>Public unique identifier of the cost entry, which is used since the version 4.1 of the database; this is formulated as follows: 'IC_x_y' with 'IC' meaning InvaCost, 'x' being the version number of the database, and 'y' being the sequential number attributed following the order of integration of costs in the database</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cost_ID</dt>
<dd>
<p>Original identifier of the cost entry, as proposed by the contributors and then confirmed/modified by the database managers to ensure consistency within the whole database.

<dd>
<p>Copy from the original reference of the sentence/paragraph indicating the habitat typology of the studied area</p>

</dd>
<dt>urbanArea</dt>
<dd>
<p>Assessment of the geographical area where the cost occurred as being strictly urban if the cost occurred in an urban area only; other if the cost occurred in a non-urban area or in a large area where urban and non-urban areas cannot be distinguished; both if the study compares the cost between urban and non-urban areas (i.e. urban vs. suburban, or suburban vs. non-urban; the comparison must be explicit) or presents the cost across contrasted areas regarding their level of urbanization (e.g. urbanization gradient). Note that we consider the urban nature of study sites purely based on an 'habitat' perspective (i.e. city versus rural areas) rather than a demographic one (e.g. population size or human density)</p>
</dd>
<dt>protectedArea</dt>
<dd>
<p>Assessment of the geographical area where the cost occurred as a protected area (Y) or not (N); NA is used if the area comprises both protected and unprotected areas, or if the protection status of the place is unknown</p>

</dd>
<dt>Geographic_region</dt>
<dd>
<p>Geographical region(s) where the cost occurred (Africa, Antarctic-Subantarctic, Asia, Central America, Europe, North America, Oceania, Pacific islands, South America); Diverse/unspecified was used when the cost estimate occurred over several regions simultaneously</p>
</dd>
<dt>Official_country</dt>
<dd>
<p>Country where the cost occurred; sometimes, this is not congruent with the geographic region as some territories (e.g., overseas areas) are located in another continent than their official country of attachment; we used information from www.naturalearthdata.com/ as a reference for country's name</p>
</dd>
<dt>State|Province|Administrative_area</dt>
<dd>
<p>The second level of geographic division (state, province or territorial administrative area) for the official country where the cost occurred</p>
</dd>
<dt>Location</dt>
<dd>
<p>When provided, the precise location (e.g., city, area) where the cost estimate occurred. Otherwise, we put (i) NA when such information was not provided and the cost entry was provided at a unit or site Spatial scale, or (ii) diverse/unspecified when such information was not provided and the cost entry was provided at global, intercontinental, continental, regional or country Spatial scale</p>
</dd>
<dt>Spatial_scale</dt>
<dd>
<p>Order of magnitude of the extent, size of the land/water area where the costs incurred. Options include: global (worldwide-scale), intercontinental (areas from two or more geographic regions), continental ('Geographic region' level), regional (several countries within a single 'Geographic region'), country, site (area at intra-country level, including USA states) and unit (well-defined surface area or entity)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Period_of_estimation</dt>
<dd>
<p>If provided, the exact period of time covered by the cost, otherwise the raw formulation provided in the reference analyzed (e.g. late 90s, during 5 years)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Time_range</dt>
<dd>
<p>Two options: period if the cost is given for a period exceeding a year; or year if the cost is given yearly or for a period up to one year. Alternatively, we put Unspecified if no information is given or guessable from the source</p>
</dd>
<dt>Probable_starting_year</dt>
<dd>
<p>Year in which the cost is known or assumed to have started to occurred. When not explicitly provided by the authors, we mentioned unspecified; in the case of a cost estimate provided for a one-year period straddling two calendar years, we mentioned the latest year of the cost occurrence.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Probable_ending_year</dt>
<dd>
<p>Year in which the cost is known or assumed to have ended. When not explicitly provided by the authors, we mentioned unspecified; in the case of a cost estimate provided for a one-year period straddling two calendar years, we mentioned the latest year of the cost occurrence.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Probable_starting_year_adjusted</dt>
<dd>
<p>Probable starting year and Probable ending year columns where the cells with unspecified information are replaced, as much as possible, by a specific year from educated guesses based on the duration time provided in the original reference (see Period of estimation column). When relevant (e.g. the authors provide a cost that occurs "since/for a well-defined number of years"), we considered the Publication year as a reference for the probable starting/ending year from which we added or subtracted the number of years provided; when vague formulations were used (e.g., early 90s), we still translated them in probable ending/starting year (e.g., 1990–1995); when annual costs were provided, but without clear information on the temporal range, we conservatively considered the year of the cost occurrence (or the Publication year, if not provided) in both columns. When no relevant approximation is feasible, we leave blank in one and/or the other column(s). These columns are those used for obtaining the number of years by which the raw cost estimates are divided to get the cot estimates per year</p>

<dt>Type_of_cost_merged</dt>
<dd>
<p>Categories of the Type of cost column reassigned into damage (economic losses due to direct and/or indirect impacts of invaders, such as yield loss, health injury, land alteration, infrastructure damage, or income reduction), management (monetary resources allocated to mitigate the spread or impacts of invaders, such as prevention, control, research, long-term management, eradication) or mixed (when when costs included both ‘damage’ and ‘management’ components); every cost for which the exact nature of cost was not clearly defined was assigned to unspecified</p>
</dd>
<dt>Management_type</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pre-invasion_management (monetary investments for preventing successful invasions in an area - including quarantine or border inspection, risk analyses, biosecurity management, etc.), post-invasion_management (money spent for managing invasions in invaded areas - including control, eradication, containment), knowledge funding (money allocated to all actions and operations that could be of interest at all steps of management at pre- and post-invasion stages - including administration, communication, education, research, etc.), or mixed was assigned when costs include at least (and without possibility to disentangle the specific proportion of) two of the previous categories; every management cost (in the Type of cost column) for which the exact nature of cost was not clearly defined was assigned to unspecified.

</dd>
<dt>Benefit_value(s)</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mention (if any) of the benefit value in the analyzed material (yes/no); 'benefit' refers here to a monetary estimate associated with profitable activities based on IAS. This definition therefore excludes any economic gain based on avoided or mitigated effects of the IAS (for instance, due to efficient management actions over time that may result in apparent benefits from avoidance of damages) - the latter is considered as an “avoided cost” in the InvaCost database. Note that the benefit figure was not recorded or described as being out of the scope of InvaCost</p>
</dd>
<dt>Details</dt>
