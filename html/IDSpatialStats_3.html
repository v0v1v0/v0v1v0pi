<h2>Simulated dataset of dengue cases with representative underlying population</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Dataset simulated using an agent based model with a spatially heterogeneous population structure. Infectious agents were
introduced resulting in agent to agent transmission. The distance between successive cases in a transmission chain were
randomly drawn from a uniform distribution U(0,100). Each infectious agent resulted in transmissions to two other agents
after a delay of 15 days, reflecting the generation time of dengue. There are 11 transmission chains, each with a different
genotype. The genotypes are subdivided into four serotypes. 500 randomly selected individuals from the underlying population
also included.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">DengueSimRepresentative
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Matrix with five columns representing the X and Y coordinates of infected individuals, the time of infection, the genotype
of the infecting pathogen and the serotype of the infecting pathogen. Individuals representative from the underlying population
have '-999'for time, genotype and serotype.
