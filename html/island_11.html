<h2>Mapped plant community time series, Dubois, ID</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A list with two datasets containing presence-absence and environmental data
for a plant community of sagebrush steppe in Dubois, Idaho, USA
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with 2 dataframes, one corresponding to the presence-absence
data and the other to the environmental variables. The first dataframe has
in columns: </p>
 <dl>
<dt>quad</dt>
<dd>
<p>Name of the quadrat surveyed</p>
</dd>
<dt>species</dt>
<dd>
<p>Name of the species found</p>
</dd> <dt>Presence-absence
data</dt>
<dd>
<p>Several columns with the year in which the surveys were conducted</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The second dataframe has the following columns: </p>
 <dl>
<dt>YEAR</dt>
<dd>
<p>Year
in which surveys were conducted</p>
</dd> <dt>Environmental variables</dt>
<dd>
<p>Data of the
recorded environmental variables in the form XXX.YYY, where XXX denotes a
month (or a total) and YYY can refer to snow (in inches), temperature
(fahrenheit degrees) or precipitation (in inches)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A historical dataset consisting of a series of permanent 1-<code class="reqn">m^2</code> quadrats
located on the sagebrush steppe in eastern Idaho, USA, between 1923 and 1973.
It also contains records of monthly precipitation, mean temperature and
snowfall. Total precipitation, total snowfall, and mean annual temperature
have been calculated from the original data.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Only quadrats Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q25 and Q26 are included here.
The surveys were conducted annually from 1932 to 1955 with some gaps for
the quadrats included here.
