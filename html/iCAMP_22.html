<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is the main function of iCAMP (Ning et al 2020). Most parameters can use the default settings. 
</p>
<p>To quantify various ecological processes, the observed taxa are first divided into different groups ('bins') based on their phylogenetic relationships. Then, the process governing each bin is identified based on null model analysis of the phylogenetic diversity using beta Net Relatedness Index (betaNRI), and taxonomic beta-diversities using modified Raup-Crick metric (RC; a typical setting of sig.index as SES.RC). For each bin, the fraction of pairwise comparisons with betaNRI &lt; -1.96 is considered as the percentages of homogeneous selection, whereas those with betaNRI &gt; +1.96 as the percentages of heterogeneous selection based on the threshold applied previously (Stegen et al 2015; Zhou and Ning 2017). Next, taxonomic diversity metric RC is used to partition the remaining pairwise comparisons with abs(NRI) &lt;= 1.96. The fraction of pairwise comparisons with RC &lt; -0.95 is treated as the percentages of homogenizing dispersal, while those with RC &gt; 0.95 as dispersal limitation (Stegen et al 2013). The remains with abs(NRI) &lt;= 1.96 and abs(RC) &lt;= 0.95 represent the percentages of drift, diversification, weak selection and/or weak dispersal(Zhou and Ning 2017), simply designated as 'drift'(Stegen et al 2013) for convenience. The above analysis is repeated for every bin. Subsequently, the fractions of individual processes across all bins are weighted by the relative abundance of each bin, and summarized to estimate the relative importance of individual processes at the whole community level. Besides betaNRI and RC, null model significance can also be inferred by direct test based on null model distribution, which should be a preferred choice when the null model simulated values do not follow normal distribution (Veech 2012). See the references for details.
</p>
<p>Bigmemory (Kane et al 2013) is used to deal with large datasets.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If omit.option is test, the output will be a table summarizing the information of small bins.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, the output is a list object, including one or more elements as below:
</p>
<p>The first one or selveral (if set 'both' for metrics and/or randomization scale) elements are matrixes of process importances at community level. In each matrix, the first two columns will be sample ID of each turnover, and the third to last column will show estimated relative importance of each process in shaping each turnover between communities (samples). The name(s) of the element(s) shows the metrics and its randomization scale, e.g. bNRIiRCa means phylogenetic null model analysis using betaNRI (i.e. SES based on betaMPD) with randomizaiton within each bin and taxonomic null model analysis using RC based on Bray-Curtis with randomization across bins. Other possible phylogenetic null-model-based metrics: bNTI, betaNTI (i.e. SES based on betaMNTD); RCbMPD, RC based on betaMPD; RCbMNTD, RC based on betaMNTD; CbMPD, confidence level based on betaMPD; CbMNTD, confidence level based on betaMNTD. Other possible taxonomic null-model-based metrics: SESbray, SES based on Bray-Curtis; CBray, confidence level based on Bray-Curtis. i, within-bin randomization; a, across-bin randomization.
