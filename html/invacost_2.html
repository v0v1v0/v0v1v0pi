<h2>Expand cost values per year of the database over relevant periods of impact</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For costs that occur over several years, this function repeats the 
cost value per year over each year of the relevant period of impact.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">expandYearlyCosts(costdb, startcolumn, endcolumn)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>costdb</code></td>
<td>
<p>The <b>'InvaCost' database</b>, usually obtained with
<code>data(invacost)</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>startcolumn</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the column containing starting years</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>endcolumn</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the column containing ending years</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> containing the 'InvaCost' database where 
all costs occurring over several years are repeated for each year.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Information on the beginning and ending years was not directly provided in
literature sources of economic costs for a substantial part of entries in the 
database (<code>Probable_starting_year</code> and <code>Probable_ending_year 
columns</code>). 
Therefore, for papers for which this information was not available,  
educated guesses were made by the 'InvaCost' team on the probable starting 
and ending years. These educated guesses were designed 
to be conservative, and make no assumption as of whether the economic impacts 
have been continued after the publication year of the material where the cost
was collected.
Therefore, we used the publication year as the probable ending year. For 
costs repeated over several years but for which no information with respect 
to the exact periods of impact was available, we counted only a single year.
These educated guesses are included in the columns (columns 
<code>Probable_starting_year_adjusted</code> and 
<code>Probable_ending_year_adjusted</code>), and we recommend using them the base 
scenario, as its conservative assumptions limit over-estimations of the 
costs.

### Cleaning steps
# Eliminating data with no information on starting and ending years
invacost &lt;- invacost[-which(is.na(invacost$Probable_starting_year_adjusted)), ]

# Keeping only observed and reliable costs
invacost &lt;- invacost[invacost$Implementation == "Observed", ]
invacost &lt;- invacost[which(invacost$Method_reliability == "High"), ]
# Eliminating data with no usable cost value
invacost &lt;- invacost[-which(is.na(invacost$Cost_estimate_per_year_2017_USD_exchange_rate)), ]

### Expansion

db.over.time &lt;- expandYearlyCosts(invacost,
                                  startcolumn = "Probable_starting_year_adjusted",
