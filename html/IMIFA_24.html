<h2>Fatty acid composition of Italian olive oils</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data on the percentage composition of eight fatty acids found by lipid fraction of 572 Italian olive oils. The data come from three areas; within each area there are a number of constituent regions, of which there are 9 in total.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(olive)
