<h2>Create dummy data for testing the completions functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates a prepared dataframe to test scripts related to IPEDS Completions reporting.
Produces either a student/degree dataframe or a dataframe of cips previously reported but not in the current student data,
depending on the argument you select
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">create_dummy_data_com(df_type = "student")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>a string: "student" to get the main df needed, "cip" to get extracips</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a dataframe ready for the rest of the comp scripts
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The final dataset has 60 students with 105 majors.
Students 100-130, 140, 150 have 1 major for 1 degree (journalism)
Students 131-139 have 2 majors for 1 degree (journalism + parks)
Students 141-149 have 3 majors for 1 degree (journalism, parks, linguistics)
Students 151-159 have 3 majors for 2 degrees (1 degree with journalism/parks, 1 MBA degree)
Note: 1 student has a faulty birthdate; this will show the warning "1 failed to parse"
</p>
<p>Two rows (level 18 linguistics) are flagged as distance education
</p>
<p>To fully process completions, we will need to include an example
of a CIP code that is a possible major but has no completers
and a CIP code in an award level that is possible but has no completers
This is the second piece of dummy df produced
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">set.seed(1892)

# one date fails to parse:
# this is to provide an example of missing
# data which is acceptable to IPEDS
students &lt;- create_dummy_data_com()

additional_cips &lt;- create_dummy_data_com(df_type = "cip")
</code></pre>
