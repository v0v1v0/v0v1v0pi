<h2>Prints plot the output from a multivariate joint model for longitudinal and/or survival data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The plots of a model are grouped by categories, first are the fixed effects and
residual error of longitudinal and survival submodels, referred to as 'Outcomes' or 'O'. Then the
variance-covariance of random effects (or standard deviations and correlations when the
argument 'sdcor' is set to TRUE in the call of the plot function), referred to as
'Covariances' or 'C'. Association parameters referred to as 'Associations' or 'A' for
linear associations and 'NL_Associations' or 'N' for non-linear associations. Baseline
hazard curves referred to as 'Baseline' or 'B' and baseline hazard related parameters
referred to as 'ParamBaseline' or 'P'. It is possible to select specific plots to
print by specifying the names or corresponding letters in the argument 'which'.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'plot.INLAjoint'
print(
  x,
  which = c("all", "Outcomes", "Covariances", "Associations", "Baseline"),
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object with the output of the the joint function</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>which</code></td>
<td>
<p>name of required plots. Default is "all".
It can be a character or named list.
If it is a list, each element can be either character or numeric to
select from the elements to be visualized.
Ex.: which = list(Outcomes = "L1") and list(Outcomes = 1)
will produce the same output.</p>
