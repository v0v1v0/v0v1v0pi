<h2>Calculate injury prevalence</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate the prevalence of injured players and the proportion of non-injured
(available) players in the cohort, on a monthly or season basis. Further
information on the type of injury may be specified so that the
injury-specific prevalences are reported according to this variable.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">injprev(injd, by = c("monthly", "season"), var_type_injury = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>injd</code></td>
<td>
<p>Prepared data. An <code>injd</code> object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character. One of "monthly" or "season", specifying the periodicity
according to which to calculate the proportions of available and injured
players/athletes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var_type_injury</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character specifying the name of the column on the
basis of which to classify the injuries and calculate proportions of the
injured players. Defaults to <code>NULL</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame containing one row for each combination of season, month
(optionally) and injury type (if <code>var_type_injury</code> not specified, then this
variable has two categories: <em>Available</em> and <em>Injured</em>). Plus, three more
columns, specifying the proportion of players (<code>prop</code>) satisfying the
corresponding row's combination of values, i.e. prevalence, how many
players were injured at that moment with the type of injury of the
corresponding row (<code>n</code>), over how many players were at that time in the
cohort (<code>n_player</code>). See Note section.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>If <code>var_type_injury</code> is specified (and not <code>NULL</code>), it may happen that a
player in one month suffers two different types of injuries. For example, a
muscle and a ligament injury. In this case, this two injuries contribute to
the proportions of muscle and ligament injuries for that month, resulting in
an overall proportion that exceeds 100%. Besides, the players in Available
category are those that did not suffer any injury in that moment
(season-month), that is, they were healthy all the time that the period
lasted
