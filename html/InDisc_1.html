<h2>
A unified approach for obtaining and estimating unidimensional Item Response Theory (IRT) Dual Models (DMs)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Package consisting on a main function (<code>InDisc</code>) that calls all the sub-functions that implement the procedures described in Ferrando (2019) for fitting binary, graded, and continuous response DMs. Estimation is based on a two stage (calibration and scoring) random-regressors approach (McDonald, 1982). Item calibration at the first stage is the same as in the corresponding standard IRT models, is based on a factor-analytic Underlying-Variables approach, and uses an unweighted least squares, (ULS) minimum-residual criterion as implemented in the <code>psych</code> R package (Revelle, 2018). Individual trait scores and individual discriminations are obtained at the second stage using Expected a Posteriori (EAP) Bayes estimation. Overall, the combined ULS-EAP estimation procedure is simple, robust, and can handle large datasets, both in terms of sample size and test length.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## For speeding purposes, the number of observations and quadrature nodes have been
## reduced. For a proper use of InDisc, use the full dataset and the default quadrature
## nodes, and consider using the graded model.

InDisc(CTAC35[1:40,], nquad = 10, model = "linear", approp = FALSE, display = TRUE)
