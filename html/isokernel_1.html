<h2>Build Isolation Kernel feature vector representations via the feature map
for a given dataset.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Isolation kernel is a data dependent kernel measure that is
adaptive to local data distribution and has more flexibility in capturing
the characteristics of the local data distribution. It has been shown promising
performance on density and distance-based classification and clustering problems.
</p>
<p>This version uses Voronoi diagrams to split the data space and calculate Isolation
kernel Similarity, following the paper: Qin, X., Ting, K.M., Zhu, Y. and Lee,
V.C., 2019, July. Nearest-neighbour-induced isolation similarity and its impact
on density-based clustering. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial
Intelligence (Vol. 33, pp. 4755-4762). Based on this implementation, the feature
in the Isolation kernel space is the index of the cell in Voronoi diagrams. Each
point is represented as a binary vector such that only the cell the point falling
into is 1.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">IKFeature(data, Sdata = data, psi = 64, t = 200, Sp = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dataset used for applying Isolation kernel function. The data is a
n by d matrix, where n is the data size, d is the dimensionality.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Sdata</code></td>
<td>
<p>The dataset use for generating Voronoi diagrams, it can be the same
as the input data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>psi</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of cells in each Voronoi diagram, it should be large
if there are more clusters or more complex structures in the data.
It could be [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of Voronoi diagrams, the higher the more stable the result.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Sp</code></td>
<td>
<p>Indicating whether return the features as a sparse matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The finite binary features based on the kernel feature map. The features
are organised as a n by psi*t matrix.
</p>
