<h2>Production Measurements of High-Tech Parts - Nearly Singular Case</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>HTP3</code> data set contains 371 high-tech parts designed for consumer
products characterized by 33 tests.
These tests are performed to ensure a high quality of the production.
All these 371 parts were considered functional and have been sold.
However the part 32 showed defects in use and was
returned to the manufacturer by the customer. Therefore this part
can be considered as outlier.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("HTP3")
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 371 rows and 33 variables V.1 - V.33,
presenting some approximate collinearity issues which may cause
some numerical inaccuracies.
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>Anonymized data from a nondisclosed manufacturer.
