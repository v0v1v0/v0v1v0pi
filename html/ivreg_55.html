<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Investigating the causal link of schooling on earnings in a classical model
for wage determinants is problematic because it can be argued that schooling
is endogenous. Hence, one possible strategy is to use an exogonous variable
as an instrument for the years of education. In his well-known study, Card (1995)
uses geographical proximity to a college when growing up as such an instrument,
showing that this significantly increases both the years of education and the
wage level obtained on the labor market. Using instrumental variables regression
Card (1995) shows that the estimated returns to schooling are much higher than
when simply using ordinary least squares.
</p>
<p>The data are taken from the supplementary material for Verbeek (2004) and are based
on the work of Card (1995). The U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men
(NLSYM) began in 1966 and included 5525 men, then aged between 14 and 24.
Card (1995) employs labor market information from the 1976 NLSYM interview which
also included information about educational attainment. Out of the 3694 men
still included in that wave of NLSYM, 3010 provided information on both wages
and education yielding the subset of observations provided in <code>SchoolingReturns</code>.
</p>
<p>The examples replicate the results from Verbeek (2004) who used the simplest
specifications from Card (1995). Including further region or family background
characteristics improves the model significantly but does not affect much the
main coefficients of interest, namely that of years of education.
