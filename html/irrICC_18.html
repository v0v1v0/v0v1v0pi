<h2>Scores assigned by 3 raters to 4 subjects.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This small dataset contains data from a reliability experiment where 3 raters scored 4 subjects on a continuous scale. All raters
rated each subject once.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">iccdata3
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This dataset has 4 rows (for the 4 subjects) and 4 columns. All 4 columns are mandatory when using the ICC functions of
this package. Rater3 only rated 2 of the 4 subjects (i.e. subjects 2 and 3), while each of the other raters rated all 4 subjects.
Therefore, some missing ratings in the form of "NA" appear in the column associated with the Rater3.
