<h2>The solution path for the case of piecewise-constant signals</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function starts by overestimating the number of true change-points.
After that, following a CUSUM-based approach, it sorts the estimated change-points
in a way that the estimate, which is most-likely to be correct appears first, whereas
the least likely to be correct, appears last. The routine is typically not called
directly by the user; it is employed in <code>pcm_ic</code>. For more information, see
References.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sol_path_pcm(x, thr_ic = 0.9, points = 3)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector containing the data in which you would like to find
change-points.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>thr_ic</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive real number with default value equal to 0.9. It is
used to define the threshold. The change-points are estimated by thresholding
with threshold equal to <code>sigma * thr_ic * sqrt(2 * log(T))</code>, where
<code>T</code> is the length of the data sequence <code>x</code> and <code>sigma = mad(diff(x)/sqrt(2))</code>.
Because we would like to overestimate the number of true change-points in <code>x</code>, it is
suggested to keep <code>thr_ic</code> smaller than 1, which is the default value used as
the threshold constant in the function <code>pcm_th</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>points</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive integer with default value equal to 3. It defines
the distance between two consecutive end- or start-points of the right- or
left-expanding intervals, respectively.</p>
