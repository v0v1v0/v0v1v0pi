<h2>
A R package for improved methods for causal inference and missing data problems
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Improved methods based on inverse probability weighting and outcome regression 
for causal inference and missing data problems.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The R package <code>iWeigReg</code> â€“ version 1.0 can be used for two main tasks:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> to estimate the mean of an outcome in the presence of missing data,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> to estimate the average treatment effect in causal inference.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 4 functions provided for the first task:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>mn.lik</code>: the non-calibrated (or non-doubly robust) likelihood estimator in Tan (2006),
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>mn.clik</code>: the calibrated (or doubly robust) likelihood estimator in Tan (2010),
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>mn.reg</code>: the non-calibrated (or non-doubly robust) regression estimator,
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>mn.creg</code>: the calibrated (or doubly robust) regression estimator in Tan (2006).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In parallel, there are also 4 functions for the second task, <code>ate.lik</code>, <code>ate.clik</code>, <code>ate.reg</code>, and <code>ate.creg</code>. Currently, the treatment is assumed to be binary (i.e., untreated or treated). Extensions to multi-valued treatments will be incorporated in later versions.
</p>
<p>In general, the function recommended to use is the calibrated (or doubly robust) likelihood estimator, <code>mn.clik</code> or <code>ate.clik</code>, which is a two-step procedure with the first step corresponding to the non-calibrated (or non-doubly robust) likelihood estimator. The calibrated (or doubly robust) regression estimator, <code>mn.creg</code> or <code>ate.creg</code>, is a close relative to the calibrated likelihood estimator, but may sometimes yield an estimate lying outside the sample range, for example, outside the unit interval (0,1) for estimating the mean of a binary outcome.
</p>
<p>The package also provides two functions, <code>mn.HT</code> and <code>ate.HT</code>, for the Horvitz-Thompson estimator, i.e., the unaugmented inverse probability weighted estimator. These functions can be used for balance checking.
