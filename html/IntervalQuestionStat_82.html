<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An educational innovation project was carried out for improving
teaching-learning processes at the University of Oviedo (Spain)
for the 2020/2021 academic year. A total of 50 students have been
requested to answer an online questionnaire about their perception
of lack of information in expository face-to-face lessons by selecting the
interval that best represents their level of agreement to the
statements proposed in a interval-valued scale bounded between 1 and 7,
where 1 means <em>strongly disagree</em> and 7 represents the option
<em>strongly agree</em>.
</p>
<p>These are the 5 items used to measure the perception of the
students about the lack of information in expository face-to-face lessons:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> I receive too little information from my classmates.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> It is difficult to receive relevant information from my classmates.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> It is difficult to receive relevant information from the teacher.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The amount of information I receive from my classmates is very low.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The amount of information I receive from the teacher is very low.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, the students have been requested to indicate their sex too.
