<h2>The War Prayer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset which contains one short story written by Mark Twain that
expresses his outrage at US military intervention in the Philippines. "It is
a scathing indictment of war, and particularly of blind patriotic and
religious fervor as motivations for war. The structure of the work is
simple: An unnamed country goes to war, and patriotic citizens attend a
church service for soldiers who have been called up. The people call upon
their God to grant them victory and protect their troops. Suddenly, an 'aged
stranger' appears and announces that he is God's messenger. He explains to
them that he is there to speak aloud the second part of their prayer for
victory, the part which they have implicitly wished for but have not spoken
aloud themselves: the prayer for the suffering and destruction of their
enemies. What follows is a grisly depiction of hardships inflicted on
war-torn nations by their conquerors. The story ends with the man being
ignored." (Source: The War Prayer [Wikipedia])  Source:
