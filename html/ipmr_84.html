<h2>Create iteration kernels from an IPM object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates iteration kernels for IPMs. <code>ipmr</code> does not create
these to iterate models, but they may be useful for further analyses.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">format_mega_kernel(ipm, ...)

## Default S3 method:
format_mega_kernel(ipm, mega_mat, ...)

## S3 method for class 'age_x_size_ipm'
format_mega_kernel(ipm, name_ps, f_forms, ...)

make_iter_kernel(ipm, ..., name_ps, f_forms)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ipm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Output from <code>make_ipm</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Other arguments passed to methods.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mega_mat</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector with symbols, I's, and/or 0s representing the matrix blocks.
They should be specified in ROW MAJOR order! Can also be a character
string specifying the call. Parameter set index syntax is supported. When used,
<code>format_mega_kernel</code> will produce as many mega-matrices as there are
combinations of <code>par_set_indices</code> in the <code>proto_ipm</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name_ps</code></td>
<td>
<p>The prefix(es) for the kernel name that correspond to survival
and growth/maturation of existing individuals. For the model
<code>K = P_age + F_age</code>, this would be <code>"P"</code>. Only applies to
age X size models. The <code>"_age"</code> suffix is appended automatically, so
does not need to be supplied.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>f_forms</code></td>
<td>
<p>The names of the kernels that correspond to production of new
individuals, and possibly, how they are combined. For example, a model that
includes sexual (with an "F" kernel) and asexual reproduction (with a "C" kernel),
this would be <code>"F + C"</code>. If data come from multiple sites or years,
then this information is supplied using the index syntax (i.e.
<code>f_forms = "F_yr + C_yr"</code>). Only applies to age X size models. The
<code>"_age"</code> index is appended automatically, so does not need to be
supplied.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>ipmr</code> does not generate complete iteration kernels, and uses
sub-kernels to iterate models. However, some further analyses are just easier
to code with a complete iteration kernel. This handles constructing those for
simple and general models of all forms. <code>format_mega_kernel</code> is used
internally by <code>make_iter_kernel</code> for general IPMs. The difference
between these two functions is that <code>make_iter_kernel</code> always returns
a list of objects with <code>c(ipmr_matrix, array, matrix)</code> classes,
whereas <code>format_mega_kernel</code> always returns a list of objects with
<code>c(array, matrix)</code> classes. The former has <code>plot()</code> methods while
the latter does not.
</p>
<p><code>I</code> and <code>0</code> represent identity matrices and 0 matrices,
respectively. They can be used to fill in blocks that represent either, without
having to create those separately and append them to the model object. The function
will work out the correct dimensions for both internally, and there is no
restriction on the number that may be used in a given call.
</p>
<p>For <code>age_size_ipm</code>s, the correct form of <code>mega_mat</code> is generated
internally by creating sub-diagonal matrices for the <code>name_ps</code> kernels,
and a top row using the <code>f_forms</code>. If parameter set indices are part of the
model, the indices should be attached to the <code>name_ps, f_forms</code> in the
function arguments, and the correct block matrices will be generated internally.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing a large matrix or many large matrices (when used with
suffix syntax). The names in the former case will be <code>"mega_matrix"</code>
and in the latter case, <code>"mega_matrix_&lt;par_sets&gt;"</code> with the levels of the
grouping effects substituted in.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(gen_di_det_ex)

big_k &lt;- make_iter_kernel(gen_di_det_ex,
                            mega_mat = c(0, go_discrete,
                                         leave_discrete, P))

char_call &lt;- c(0, "go_discrete", "leave_discrete", "P")

big_k_c &lt;- make_iter_kernel(gen_di_det_ex, mega_mat = char_call)

# Now, with an Identity matrix instead of a 0

big_k &lt;- make_iter_kernel(gen_di_det_ex,
                            mega_mat = c(I, go_discrete,
                                         leave_discrete, P))

# For simple IPMs with no grouping effects, this computes the sum of
# the sub-kernels (i.e. K = P + F)

data(sim_di_det_ex)

simple_k &lt;- make_iter_kernel(sim_di_det_ex)
