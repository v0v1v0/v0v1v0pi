<h2>Differential Scanning Calorimetry curves</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>90 samples of calcium oxalate were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry technique (DSC),
obtaining 90 DSC curves showing from an SDT device the difference of heat between a sample and an oxalate reference
value depending on the temperature that the samples are heated at a constant temperature rate.
The data set consists of 15 TG curves of 1000 observations from each of the 6 laboratories.
Laboratory 2 to Laboratory 4 uses the same simultaneous SDT analyzer in similar conditions,
Laboratory 6 uses a simultaneous SDT analyzer with an old calibration, and Laboratory 7 uses a simultaneous SDT
analyzer with a calibration (2 degrees Celsius displaced from the zinc melting point).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>5 x 1000 x 6 dimension array, where each matrix consists of the 15 DSC curves obtained by testing 15 different oxalate
samples, and evaluated at 1000 different temperature values. These 15 curves were obtained for each of the 6 laboratories that
performed the experiments.
