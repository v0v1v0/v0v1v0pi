<h2>
Converts capture-histories to an m-array for one age class
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates an m-array for a single- or multistate capture-recapture data with one age class and optionally more than one group.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">marray(ch, unobs = 0, freq = 1, groups = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ch</code></td>
<td>

<p>an individuals x time matrix with single- or multistate capture histories (0: not captured; 1...X: captured in the 1...X states). See Details.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>unobs</code></td>
<td>

<p>number of unobserved states (default is 0, needs to be given only in specific cases).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>freq</code></td>
<td>

<p>a vector with the number of animals with each capture history, or a matrix with a column for each group. If a single value is supplied, it will be used for all rows in the capture history; the default is to assume each row corresponds to a single animal.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>groups</code></td>
<td>

<p>a factor (or a vector that can be coerced to a factor) which identifies the group that each row of <code>ch</code> refers to. Ignored if <code>freq</code> is a matrix with &gt; 1 column.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The argument <code>ch</code> can be a matrix of unique capture histories accompanied by a vector or matrix, <code>freq</code>, specifying the number of animals with each capture history. Trap losses can be indicated either by negative values for <code>freq</code>, or by filling the row with NA after the last capture. For other formats, see <code>ch2matrix</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>For single-state capture recapture data, an m-array which is a (years-1) x years x groups array, where element [i, j, g] contains the number of individuals in group g released in year i and recaptured in year j+1 (by definition no recaptures can occur in year 1). If no groups are specified, this will be a (years-1) x years matrix. The last column contains the number of individuals released in year i and never recaptured.
</p>
<p>For multi-state capture-recapture data with s states (including potential unobservable states), an m-array which is a (years-1)*s x (years-1)*2 + 1 x groups array. An element [i, j, g] contains the number of individuals in group g released in year t and state n (i = (t-1)*s + n) and recaptured in year k+1 in state m (j = (k-1)*s + m). If no groups are specified, this will be a matrix. The last column contains the number of individuals released in year t and state s and never recaptured. The labeling of unobserved states starts with the number of observed states + 1.
