<h3>Description</h3>

<p>calculating elasticity of a linear price response function
This function is helpful to determine if your product is elastic or not based on a linear price response function. if product demand is
not linear to price, try using the single product optimization function instead. The price elasticity of demand
which is often shortened to demand elasticity
is defined to be the percentage change in quantity demanded, q, divided by the percentage change in price, p.
When Elasticity bigger 1, we say the good is price elastic.In this case, percentQ bigger percentP, and so, for a 1 percent change in price, there 
is a greater than 1 percent
change in quantity demanded.In this case, management should decrease price to have a higher revenue.
When Elasticity smaller 1, we say the good is price inelastic.In this case, percentQ smaller percentP, and so, for a 1 percent change in price, there 
is a less than 1 percent change
in quantity demanded.In this case, management should increase price to have a higher revenue.
When Elasticity equal 1, we say the good is price unit elastic.In this case, percentQ equal percentP , and so, for a 1percent change in price,
there is also an 1percent change in quantity demanded.
This is the optimal price which means it maximizes revenue.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">linear_elasticity(prices, Sales, present_price, cost_of_product, plot = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prices</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of prices.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Sales</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of sales against each price .</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>present_price</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric,  present price of the product .</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cost_of_product</code></td>
<td>
<p>cost of the product, if the product/service has no cost ,then cost is set to zero.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>Default is false,if true, a plot is generated</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the elasticity at the present price , the price for optimum revenue and thee price for optimum cost.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>this is the third version of the inventorize package, all the functions are  without
any academic contribution from my side, the aim is to facilitate and ease much of the bookkeeping that is endured during stock analysis.
