<h2>Scores assigned by 4 judges to 5 targets/subjects.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains data from a reliability experiment where 4 judges scored 5 subjects on a continuous scale. Some of
these 5 subjects were rated multiple times. Subject 1 for example was rated 3 times by judges 1, 3 and 4, and twice by
judge 2. This explains the number of records being larger than the number of subjects.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">iccdata1
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This dataset has 12 rows (for the 5 subjects) and 5 columns. All 5 columns are mandatory when using the ICC functions of
this package. None of the 4 judges scored all 5 subjects. Judge 4 for example did not score subject 3. Moreover, the subjects
scored by all judges did not receive the same number of ratings.  Therefore, some missing ratings in the form of "NA" appear
in the columns associated with the remaining all judges.
