<h2>Simulated data for ISVA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A synthetic data set of 750 features and 50 samples with a binary phenotype
and two confounding factors. Relative effect size of confounding
factors (CFs) to that of phenotype of interest is 2. For further details please
see reference.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">simdataISVA</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This synthetic data set is a list object containing the following
elements: (i) data is the data matrix (750 features, 50 samples),
(ii) pheno is a binary phenotype vector, (iii) factors is a list of
length two containing the two binary confounding factors, (iv) deg is
the index vector of those truly differentially "expressed" features, (v)
degL is a list of index vectors for features truly differentially
altered (first element,degL[[1]]=deg) and those features affected by CFs (2nd and
3rd elements).
