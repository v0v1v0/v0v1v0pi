<h2>Multiple change-point detection in the mean via thresholding</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function performs the Isolate-Detect methodology (see Details for the
relevant literature reference) with the thresholding-based stopping rule
in order to detect multiple change-points in the mean of a noisy input vector
<code>x</code>, with Gaussian noise. See Details for a brief explanation of the
Isolate-Detect methodology, and of the thresholding-based stopping rule.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pcm_th(x, sigma = stats::mad(diff(x)/sqrt(2)), thr_const = 1,
  thr_fin = sigma * thr_const * sqrt(2 * log(length(x))), s = 1,
  e = length(x), points = 3, k_l = 1, k_r = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector containing the data in which you would like to find
change-points.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sigma</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive real number. It is the estimate of the standard deviation
of the noise in <code>x</code>. The default value is the median absolute deviation of <code>x</code>
computed under the assumption that the noise is independent and identically distributed
from the Gaussian distribution.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>thr_const</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive real number with default value equal to 1. It is
used to define the threshold; see <code>thr_fin</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>thr_fin</code></td>
<td>
<p>With <code>T</code> the length of the data sequence, this is a positive real
number with default value equal to <code>sigma * thr_const * sqrt(2 * log(T))</code>. It is
the threshold, which is used in the detection process.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>s, e</code></td>
<td>
<p>Positive integers with <code>s</code> less than <code>e</code>, which indicate
that you want to check for change-points in the data sequence with subscripts
in <code>[s,e]</code>. The default values are <code>s</code> equal to 1 and
<code>e</code> equal to <code>T</code>, with <code>T</code> the length of the data sequence.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>points</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive integer with default value equal to 3. It defines
the distance between two consecutive end- or start-points of the right- or
left-expanding intervals, respectively; see Details for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k_l, k_r</code></td>
<td>
<p>Positive integer numbers that get updated whenever the function
calls itself during the detection process. They are not essential for the
function to work, and we include them only to reduce the computational time.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The change-point detection algorithm that is used in <code>pcm_th</code> is the
Isolate-Detect methodology described in “Detecting multiple generalized
change-points by isolating single ones”, Anastasiou and Fryzlewicz (2018), preprint.
The concept is simple and is split into two stages; firstly, isolation of each
of the true change-points in subintervals of the data domain, and secondly their detection.
ID first creates two ordered sets of <code class="reqn">K = \lceil T/\code{points}\rceil</code> right- and left-expanding
intervals as follows. The <code class="reqn">j^{th}</code> right-expanding interval is <code class="reqn">R_j = [1, j\times \code{points}]</code>,
while the <code class="reqn">j^{th}</code> left-expanding interval is <code class="reqn">L_j = [T - j\times \code{points} + 1, T]</code>.
We collect these intervals in the ordered set <code class="reqn">S_{RL} = \lbrace R_1, L_1, R_2, L_2, ... , R_K, L_K\rbrace</code>.
For a suitably chosen contrast function, ID first identifies the point with the maximum contrast
value in <code class="reqn">R_1</code>. If its value exceeds a certain threshold, then it is taken as a change-point.
If not, then the process tests the next interval in <code class="reqn">S_{RL}</code> and repeats the above process.
Upon detection, the algorithm makes a new start from estimated location.
