<h2>Study design in the presence of error-prone diagnostic tests and 
self-reported outcomes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function calculates the power and sample in the presence of error-prone 
diagnostic tests and self-reported outcomes.  Two missing mechanisms can be 
assumed, namely MCAR and NTFP. The MCAR setting assumes that each test is 
subject to a constant, independent probability of missingness. The NTFP 
mechanism includes two types of missingness - (1) incorporates a constant, 
independent, probability of missing for each test prior to the first positive
test result; and (2) all test results after first positive are missing.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">icpower(
  HR,
  sensitivity,
  specificity,
  survivals,
  N = NULL,
  power = NULL,
  rho = 0.5,
  alpha = 0.05,
  pmiss = 0,
  pcensor = 0,
  design = "MCAR",
  negpred = 1
)

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>HR</code></td>
<td>
<p>hazard ratio under the alternative hypothesis.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sensitivity</code></td>
<td>
<p>the sensitivity of test.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>specificity</code></td>
<td>
<p>the specificity of test</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>survivals</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of survival function at each test time for 
baseline(reference) group. Its length determines the number of tests.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>N</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of sample sizes to calculate corresponding powers. If one 
needs to calculate sample size, then set to NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>power</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of powers to calculate corresponding sample sizes. If 
one needs to calculate power, then set to NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rho</code></td>
<td>
<p>proportion of subjects in baseline(reference) group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>type I error.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pmiss</code></td>
<td>
<p>a value or a vector (must have same length as survivals) of the 
probabilities of each test being randomly missing at each test time. If 
pmiss is a single value, then each test is assumed to have an identical 
probability of missingness.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pcensor</code></td>
<td>
<p>a value or a vector (must have same length as survivals) of
the interval probabilities of censoring time at each interval, 
assuming censoring process
is independent on other missing mechanisms. If it is the single value, then
we assume same interval probabilities as the value. The sum of pcensor (or 
pcensor * length(survivals) if it is single value) must be &lt;= 1. For example,
if pcensor = c(0.1, 0.2), then it means the the probabilities of censoring time
in first and second intervals are 0.1, 0.2, and the probability of not being
censored is 0.7.</p>

<p>missing mechanism: "MCAR" or "NTFP".</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>negpred</code></td>
<td>
<p>baseline negative predictive value, i.e. the probability of 
being truely disease free for those who were tested (reported) as disease 
free at baseline. If baseline screening test is perfect, then negpred = 1.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To calculate sample sizes for a vector of powers, set N = NULL. To 
calculate powers for a vector of sample sizes, set power = NULL. One and 
only one of power and N should be specified, and the other set to NULL. 
This function uses an enumeration algorithm to calculate the expected 
Fisher information matrix. The expected Fisher information matrix is used 
to obtain the variance of the coefficient corresponding to the treatment 
group indicator.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

 <ul>
<li>
<p> result: a data frame with calculated sample size and 
power </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> I1 and I2: calculated unit Fisher information matrices for each
group, which can be used to calculate more values of sample size and power 
for the same design without the need to enumerate again </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>When diagnostic test is perfect, i.e. sensitivity=1 and 
specificity=1, use <code>icpowerpf</code> instead to obtain significantly 
improved computational efficiency.
