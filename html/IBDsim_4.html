IBD simulation
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is the main function of the package. Gene dropping of chromosomes is simulated down the pedigree, either unconditionally or conditional on the 'condition' pattern if this is given. Regions showing the 'query' pattern are collected and summarized. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">IBDsim(x, sims, query=NULL, condition=NULL, map="decode", 
       chromosomes=NULL, model="chi", merged=TRUE, simdata=NULL, 
       skip.recomb = "noninf_founders", seed=NULL, verbose=TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>A pedigree in the form of a <code>linkdat</code> object.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sims</code></td>
<td>

<p>The number of simulations.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>query, condition</code></td>
<td>

<p>Single allele patterns (SAPs), described as lists with numerical entries named "0", "1", "2", "atleast1", "atmost1".
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>map</code></td>
<td>

<p>The genetic map(s) to be used in the simulations: One of the character strings "decode", "uniform.sex.spec", "uniform.sex.aver". (See Details.)
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>chromosomes</code></td>
<td>

<p>A numeric vector indicating chromosome numbers, or either of the words "AUTOSOMAL" or "X". The default is 1:22, i.e. the human autosomes.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>

<p>A character indicating the statistical model for recombination: Either "chi" (the default) or "haldane". (See details.)
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>merged</code></td>
<td>

<p>A logical, indicating if overlapping/adjacent regions should be merged or not.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>simdata</code></td>
<td>

<p>Either NULL, in which case simulation is performed before collecting IBD regions, or an object containing simulation data (typically generated by a previous run of <code>IBDsim</code>).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each simulation starts by unique alleles being distributed to the pedigree founders.  In each subsequent meiosis, homologue chromosomes are made to recombine according to a renewal process along the four-strand bundle, with chi square distributed waiting times.  (For comparison purposes, Haldane's Poisson model for recombination is also implemented.)
</p>
<p>Recombination rates are sex-dependent, and vary along each chromosome according to the recombination map specified by the <code>map</code> parameter. By default, the complete Decode map of the human autosome is used (see References).  If <code>map="uniform.sex.spec"</code>, the genetic chromosome <em>lengths</em> are as in the Decode map, but the recombination rate is kept constant along each chromosome.  If <code>map="uniform.sex.aver"</code>, sex averaged genetic chromosome lengths are used (and constant recombination rates along each chromosome). 
</p>
<p>IBD patterns are described as combinations of Single Allele Patterns (SAPs).  A SAP is a specification for a given allele of the number of copies carried by various individuals, and must be given as a list of numerical vectors (containing ID labels) named '0', '1', '2', 'atleast1' and 'atmost1' (some of these can be absent or NULL; see Examples).
</p>
<p>If a condition SAP is given (i.e. if <code>condition</code> is non-null), simulation of each complete chromosome set (all autosomes by default) is performed as follows:  A 'disease chromosome' is sampled at random (using the physical chromosome lengths as weights), followed by a random 'disease locus' on this chromosome.  For this chromosome, gene dropping down the pedigree is carried out in such a way that the 'disease locus' has the condition SAP.  (In a bit more detail: First, the program computes all possible sets of obligate carriers, with suitable weights, and samples one of these.  Included in the obligate carriers will be exactly one founder, one of whose alleles is taken as the 'disease allele'.  In each meiosis involving obligate carriers, recombination is performed as usual, but the strand carrying the 'disease allele' is always the one passed on.) For the other chromosomes, simulation is done unconditionally. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If the <code>query</code> is NULL, no identification of IBD segments is done, and only the simulated genomes are (invisibly) returned.  
</p>
<p>If <code>query</code> is non-null, the segments with the query SAP are identified, and a list of three elements is returned. These are the 'simdata' (the simulated genomes), the 'segments' (a list of matrices describing all identified regions) and finally 'stats' (a matrix with one column per simulation, summarizing the regions from that genome).
A summary is printed on the screen, with some or all of the following slots: 
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>count.all</code></td>
<td>

<p>The average count of all IBD segments (i.e. counting both random regions and the disease region in case of conditional simulation).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fraction.all</code></td>
<td>

<p>The average fraction (in %) of the genome covered by IBD segments.
</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<p>The term 'IBD segment' in the above always refers to 'IBD segment matching the query SAP'. 
The suffixes <code>.dis</code>, <code>.rand</code> and <code>.all</code> points to respectively the 
<em>disease</em> IBD segments (only relevant in conditional simulations), the <em>random</em>, i.e. non-disease, IBD segments (only relevant in conditional simulations), 
and <em>all</em> IBD segments (in any simulation).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># In all examples below, the 'sims' parameter is set to 1 to 
# decrease runtime. For realistic results increase to e.g. 1000.

#### An example with a recessive disease in a consanguineous pedigree:

x = linkdat(twoloops)
plot(x)

# If individuals 15, 16 and 17 are available for sequencing, we can 
# predict the number and size of disease-compatible IBD segments as 
# follows:

sap1 = list('2'=15:16, 'atmost1'=17)
IBDsim(x, sims=1, condition=sap1, query=sap1)

# If 16 is unavailable, his parents and healthy sibling are still 
# informative. The regions we are looking for now are those with 
# an allele present in 2 copies in 15, 1 copy in 12 and 14, and 
# at most one in 17. Note that the condition SAP remains as above.

IBDsim(x, sims=1, condition=sap1, 
       query=list('2'=15, '1'=c(12,14), 'atmost1'=17))

	   
#### Example with an autosomal dominant disorder:
y = linkdat(dominant1) # lazy load data
plot(y)

# Suppose a 20 Mb linkage peak is found. 
# How often would this occur by chance?

aff = which(dominant1[,'AFF']==2)   # the affected
nonaff = which(dominant1[,'AFF']==1)   # the non-affected
dom_pattern = list('1'=aff, '0'=nonaff)
res = IBDsim(y, sims=1, query=dom_pattern) 
mean(res$stats['longest.all',] &gt; 20)   # the estimated p-value


#### Another example: Unconditional simulation of regions shared 
# IBD by third cousins. The "zeroprob" entry in the output shows 
# the percentage of simulations having no IBD-sharing among the 
# two cousins. (Again: Increase 'sims' for more accurate results.)

x_male = cousinPed(3)
plot(x_male)
IBDsim(x_male, sims=1, query=list('1'=15:16))

# Changing the genders of the individuals connecting the cousins 
# can have a big impact on the distribution of IBD segments:

x_female = swapSex(x_male, c(3,4,7,8,11,12))
plot(x_female)
IBDsim(x_female, sims=1, query=list('1'=15:16))

## Given that the two third cousins have at least one segment in 
# common, what is the expected length of this segment? We simulate 
# conditional on one allele in common between the cousins. The 
# "length.dis" entry of the summary shows the average length of 
# the disease region (which should be quite a lot larger than 
# an average random segment).

sap = list('1'=15:16)
IBDsim(x_male, sims=1, condition=sap, query=sap)


#### Let us look at a different relationship: Half first cousins. 
# Two such cousins will on average share 1/8 = 12.5% of the autosome.  

z = halfCousinPed(1)
plot(z)
res = IBDsim(z, sims=1, query=list('1'=8:9)) 
res$stats

# visualizing the spread in total IBD sharing and the number of segments:

IBD_percent = res$stats['fraction.all', ]
IBD_count = res$stats['count.all', ]
hist(IBD_percent) 
hist(IBD_count)
