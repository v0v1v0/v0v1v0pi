<h2>Reconstruct individual patient data (IPD) from Scanned Kaplan-Meier(K-M) curves</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>After the raw dataset is processed using the <code>preprocess</code> function, we can use the <code>getIPD()</code> function to reconstruct the IPD.
Here the total number of events (tot.events) is an optional input; and the treatment arm can be arbitrarily assigned to label the
patients' treatment group (Typically, 0 for the control group, and 1 for the treatment group). <br><br>
The output is the reconstructed IPD in the form of a three-column table (i.e.,time, patient status, and treatment group ID). <br><br>
In addition, in order to evaluate the accuracy of our reconstruction process, we will calculate the survival probabilities at each read-in time points
based on the reconstructed IPD, then compare them with the corresponding read-in survival probabilities. The test statistics are also included in the
output.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getIPD(prep,armID=1,tot.events=NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prep</code></td>
<td>
<p>the class object returned from the <code>preprocess()</code> function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>armID</code></td>
<td>
<p>the arbitrary lable used as the group indicator for the reconstructed IPD. Typically 0 for the control group and 1 for the treatment group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tot.events</code></td>
<td>
<p>the total number of events. This may not be available for some published curves, thus this input is optional.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>getIPD()</code> returns a list object, including four items as follows. <br><br>
IPD:  the estimated individual patient in a three-column table (i.e.time, status, and treatment group indicator).  <br><br>
Points:   the data frame shows estimations of parameters at each read-in time points. <br><br>
riskmat:  the data frame shows index of read-in points within each time interval, as well as the estimated numbers of censored patients and events within each time interval.<br><br>
kstest:   the test statistics and p value of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test when comparing the distributions of estimated and read-in K-M curves. The null hypothesis is the read-in and estimated survival probabilities are from the same distribution.<br><br>
precision:   a list shows the root mean squre error(RMSE), mean absolute error and max absolute error which measure the differences between the estimated and read-in survival probabilities. <br><br>
endpts:  the number of patients remaining at the end of trial.<br><br></p>
