<h2>Split a VCF into SBS, DBS, and ID VCFs, plus a list of other mutations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Split a VCF into SBS, DBS, and ID VCFs, plus a list of other mutations
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SplitOneVCF(vcf.df, max.vaf.diff = 0.02, name.of.VCF = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vcf.df</code></td>
<td>
<p>An in-memory data.frame representing a VCF, including
VAFs, which are added by <code>ReadVCF</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max.vaf.diff</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum difference of VAF, default value is 0.02. If
the absolute difference of VAFs for adjacent SBSs is bigger than
<code>max.vaf.diff</code>, then these adjacent SBSs are likely to be "merely"
asynchronous single base mutations, opposed to a simultaneous doublet
mutation or variants involving more than two consecutive bases.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name.of.VCF</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the VCF file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with 3 in-memory VCFs and discarded variants that were not
incorporated into the first 3 VCFs:
</p>
<p>* <code>SBS</code>: VCF with only single base substitutions.
</p>
<p>* <code>DBS</code>: VCF with only doublet base substitutions
as called by Mutect.
</p>
<p>* <code>ID</code>: VCF with only small insertions and deletions.
</p>
<p>* <code>discarded.variants</code>: <strong>Non-NULL only if</strong> there are variants
that were excluded from the analysis. See the added extra column
<code>discarded.reason</code> for more details.
