<h2>Nematodes in herring fillets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An experiment was carried out in order to investigate the migration of
nematodes in Danish herrings. The fish were allocated to eight
different treatment groups corresponding to different combinations of
storage time and storage conditions until filleting.  After filleting,
it was determined whether nematodes were present in the fillet or not.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(herring)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 884 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>group</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector that is the combination of
storage and time</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>time</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector that contains the duration of
storage in hours before the fish is filleted</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>condi</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector representing the storage condition</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>fillet</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector to indicate the presence of
nematodes (1) or absence of nematodes (0)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The variable group is the combination of storage condition and
storage time.  Notice that a storage time 0 is equivalent to storage
condition 0 and that no fish were stored 132 hours under condition
4. Hence, there are only 8 combinations; i.e., 8 levels of the group
variable.
