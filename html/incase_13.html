<h2>incase: Pipe-Friendly Vector Replacement with Case Statements</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Offers a pipe-friendly alternative to <code>dplyr::case_when()</code> and
<code>dplyr::if_else()</code>.
These functions accept a vector as an optional first argument, allowing
conditional statements to be built using the magrittr
dot operator.
The functions also coerce all possible outputs to the same type, meaning you
no longer have to worry about using specific typed variants of <code>NA</code> or
explicitly declaring integer outputs.
