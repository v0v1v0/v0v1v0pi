<h2>dl.sigmadl</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>claculating demand lead time,saftey stock when there is a  leadtime variability.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dl.sigmadl(expected_demand, sd_demand, expected_leadtime, sd_leadtime)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>expected_demand, </code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric,expected daily demand .</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sd_demand</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric,standard deviation of daily demand .</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>expected_leadtime</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric,  expected leadtime in days.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sd_leadtime</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric,standard deviation of leadtime</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>calculating leadtime with leadtime variablility as delivery time diffires to long distances and reliability of mode of transport.
thus demand leadtime and standard deviation during lead time takes into consideration the lead time variability.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a dataframe that contains calculations of the expected demand lead time and the expected saftey stock during leadtime. It is noted that saftey stock here is
more than normal due to leadtime variability.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>this is the second version of the inventorize package, all the fucntions are  without
any academic contribution from my side, the aim is to facilitate and ease much of the bookkeeping that is endured during stock analysis.
