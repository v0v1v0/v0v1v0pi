<h2>Calculate Cohen's Kappa Coefficient</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function calculates weighted or unweighted Kappa
coefficient for two sets of ratings. Kappa coefficient quantifies the
agreement between two sets of ratings (like two raters) beyond what is
expected by chance. It can be used as a measure of inter-rater reliability.
</p>
<p>If the ratings are ordinal (for example Likert scale), weighted kappa
coefficient can be used. Weighted Kappa penalizes the larger discrepancies
between raters. More emphasis is put to large differences between rating
and small emphasis will be put on smaller differences. The available
weighting options are <code>"linear"</code> and <code>"quadratic"</code>. By default
the function calculates <code>"unweighted"</code> Kappa coefficient.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">kappa_coef(x, weights = "unweighted")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix/data.frame with two columns where each column contains
a set of ratings. When <code>weights = "linear"</code> or
<code>weights = "quadratic"</code>, each row should be an ordered factor or
numbers. The rows with missing values (i.e. <code>NA</code>) will be removed
from the analysis.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either a string representing the weighting method. Or, a
square matrix of weights that will be applied to the cross table
(assuming the ratings are ordered factors or numeric).
There are three possible weighting methods (aside from the custom
weights method):
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>'unweighted'</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the original Kappa coefficient where no weighting applied.
This is the default method. This method is appropriate for both
nominal (i.e. unordered) data or ordinal (i.e. ordered) data.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>'linear'</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Linear weights applied.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>'quadratic'</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Quadratic weights applied. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A Kappa coefficient which is a number between -1 and 1. 1 means
perfect agreement between ratings. 0 means agreement between rating is no
better than agreement one would get merely by chance. Negative values means
the agreement is even worse than one would get by chance.
