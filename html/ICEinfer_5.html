<h2>Data from a double-blind clinical trial comparing fluoxetine plus pindolol with fluoxetine alone</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data are from a Spanish double-blind clinical trial in which 55 patients were
randomized to fluoxetine (an SSRI) plus pindolol (a Beta Blocker) and 56 patients were randomized
to fluoxetine plus placebo for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), Sacristan et al.
(2000).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(fluoxpin)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame of 3 variables on 111 patients; no NAs.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>respond</dt>
<dd>
<p>Patients are considered to have responded to treatment when a 50% or greater
decrease in HAMD-17 total score occurred between baseline and end-point (at day 42), with
no more than 10% additional variation between intermediate visits.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>cost</dt>
<dd>
<p>Resource utilization was prospectively collected alongside the clinical trial.
Patients and caregivers were interviewed by the researcher concerning all resources consumed
during the study period. Resources dictated by the protocol were not counted.  Costs are
expressed in Pesetas (Pts.) at 1996 prices (1 Dollar = 145 Pts.)  Observed differences in average
direct medical costs were mainly due to hospitalizations within the FlxPin = 0 group.   
</p>
</dd>
<dt>flxpin</dt>
<dd>
<p>Treatment indicator variable. FlxPin = 1 implies receipt of fluoxetine 20 mg/day
plus pindolol 7.5 mg/day (2.5 mg tid).  FlxPin = 0 implies receipt of fluoxetine 20 mg/day
plus placebo (tid).
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Since both samples are rather small (55 and 56 patients) here and the Effectiveness variable,
respond, is binary, this example illustrates how the Law of Large Numbers can fail to apply to
ICE inferences.  Specifically, the bootstrap distribution of sample differences between AVERAGES
appears to be quite different from bivariate normal in three ways: (i) The Bootstrap Distribution
of ICE Uncertainty appears to consist of vertical stripes because the horizontal variable is
discrete here while the vertical variable is continuous. (ii) The Bootstrap Distribution of cost
differences appears to end somewhat abruptly near the horizontal axis at DeltaCost = 0, rather
than have a long upwards tail like its downwards tail.  (iii)  The equal density contours of the
bivariate Bootstrap Distribution appear to NOT be elliptical.  This third point can be
dramatically illustrated by computing the Owen Empirical Likelihood contour that passes through
the origin of the ICE plane.
