<h2>A windows-based approach for multiple change-point detection in a continuous,
piecewise-linear signal via thresholding</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function performs the windows-based variant of the Isolate-Detect methodology
with the thresholding-based stopping rule in order to detect multiple change-points
in a continuous, piecewise-linear noisy data sequence, with the noise being Gaussian.
It is particularly helpful for very long data sequences, as due to applying Isolate-Detect
on moving windows, the computational time is reduced. See Details for a brief explanation of
this approach and for the relevant literature reference.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">win_cplm_th(xd, sigma = stats::mad(diff(diff(xd)))/sqrt(6), thr_con = 1.4,
  c_win = 3000, w_points = 3, l_win = 12000)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xd</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector containing the data in which you would like to find
change-points.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sigma</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive real number. It is the estimate of the standard deviation
of the noise in <code>xd</code>. The default value is <code>mad(diff(diff(xd)))/sqrt(6)</code>, where
<code>mad(xd)</code> denotes the median absolute deviation of <code>xd</code> computed under the
assumption that the noise is independent and identically distributed from the
Gaussian distribution.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>thr_con</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive real number with default value equal to 1.4. It is
used to define the threshold. The change-points are estimated by thresholding
with threshold equal to <code>sigma * thr_con * sqrt(2 * log(T))</code>, where
<code>T</code> is the length of the data sequence <code>xd</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>c_win</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive integer with default value equal to 3000. It is the length
of each window for the data sequence in hand. Isolate-Detect will be applied
in segments of the form <code>[(i-1) * c_win + 1, i * c_win]</code>, for <code class="reqn">i=1,2,...,K</code>,
where <code class="reqn">K</code> depends on the length <code>T</code> of the data sequence.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>w_points</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive integer with default value equal to 3. It defines
the distance between two consecutive end- or start-points of the right- or
left-expanding intervals, respectively.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>l_win</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive integer with default value equal to 12000. If the length of
the data sequence is less than or equal to <code>l_win</code>, then the windows-based approach
will not be applied and the result will be obtained by the classical Isolate-Detect
methodology based on thresholding.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The method that is implemented by this function is based on splitting the given
data sequence uniformly into smaller parts (windows), to which Isolate-Detect, based on the
thresholding stopping rule (see <code>cplm_th</code>), is then applied.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric vector with the detected change-points.
