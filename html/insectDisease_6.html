<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides a 'R' workspace with insect disease database data already
present. Data are visible by using the R command ls("package:InsectDisease")', and individual
data frames can be imported to your local workspace by using the command 'data(NAMEOFDATA)'
</p>
<p>Data frames can be grouped by parasite type, as 'nemaref', 'nematode' and 'newnema' provide information on nematode infections, as 'nvpassoc' provides information on protozoans, and 'viraref' and 'viruses' provide details of viral infections. 'pathogen' provides general taxonomic information on pathogens in the database. Citations are available in a number of places, including but not limited to 'assocref', 'citation', 'nemaref', and 'viraref'.
