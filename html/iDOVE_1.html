<h2>Durability of Vaccine Efficacy Against Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Assesses potentially time-varying vaccine efficacy (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 
infection under staggered enrollment and time-varying community transmission, 
allowing crossover of placebo volunteers to the vaccine arm. The infection 
time data are interval-censored, and the log hazard ratio is assumed to be 
a piece-wise linear function of time.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">idove(
  formula,
  data,
  constantVE = FALSE,
  plots = TRUE,
  changePts = NULL,
  timePts = NULL,
  tol = 1e-04,
  maxit = 2000
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>A formula object, with all of the time variables
on the left hand side of a '~' operator and the covariates on the right. 
The time variables must be specified through the intCens() function. 
See ?intCens and Details for further information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data.frame object. The data.frame in which to interpret the
variable names in formula. Must contain the entry time, the left interval
time, the right interval time, the vaccination time, and any covariates. 
See Details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>constantVE</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical object. If FALSE (default), VE is assumed to be 
potentially waning after the last change point; 
otherwise it is assumed to be constant after the last change point.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plots</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical object. If TRUE (default), plots of the estimated 
VE in reducing attack rate, the estimated VE in reducing the hazard rate, 
and their 95% confidence intervals will be automatically generated. 
If FALSE, plots will not be generated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>changePts</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer vector object or NULL. The potential change
points (in days) of the piece-wise log-linear hazard ratio. See Details 
for further information. 
If NULL, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) will be used to select 
one change point from {28, 35, 42, 49, 56} (weeks 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>timePts</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer vector object or NULL. The endpoints (in days) 
of the time periods for which the VE in reducing the attack rate are to
be estimated. The estimated VE in reducing the hazard rate at 
these endpoints are also returned. If NULL, a default sequence 
<code class="reqn">t_1, 2t_1, 3t_1, \dots</code> will be used, where <code class="reqn">t_1</code> is the first 
change point. The sequence ends at the maximum of the left and
and right ends of the time intervals from all participants. This input is 
ignored when constantVE = TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tol</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric scalar object. The convergence threshold for the EM algorithm. 
The default value is 0.0001.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxit</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive integer object. The maximum number of iterations for the 
EM algorithm. The default value is 2000.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The information required for an analysis is 
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Entry Time:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The time when the participant enters the trial 
in whole units days.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Left Interval Time:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The last examination time when the test is 
negative in whole units days.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Right Interval Time:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The first examination time when the test 
is positive in whole units days. If the participant does not 
test positive during the trial, use NA or Inf.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Vaccination Time:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The time when vaccination takes place in 
whole units days. If the participant is not vaccinated during 
the trial, use NA or Inf.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Covariates:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Baseline covariates (e.g., priority group, age, 
ethnicity).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The covariates can include categorical variables, for which
all other categories are compared to the first category.
A model without covariates is also allowed.
</p>
<p>Note that all of the time variables are measured from the start of the 
clinical trial and are specified in whole units of days. Though they
need not be provided as integer, all non-NA and finite values must be able 
to be cast as integers without loss of information. For each 
individual, the entry_time and left_time should satisfy
entry_time <code class="reqn">\le</code> left_time. For each individual that tests positive, 
entry_time <code class="reqn">\le</code> left_time <code class="reqn">\le</code> right_time. For each individual 
that is vaccinated, entry_time <code class="reqn">\le</code> vaccination_time.
</p>
<p>The general structure of the formula input is
</p>
<pre>
  intCens(entry_time, left_time, right_time, vaccination_time) ~ covariates 
  </pre>
<p>The left-hand side contains all of the time information. It must be
specified through function 'intCens()'. Specifically, 
</p>
<pre>intCens(entry_time, left_time, right_time, vaccination_time)</pre>
<p>If entry_time &gt; left_time, or left_time &gt; right_time, the case will be 
removed from the analysis and a message will be generated. 
</p>
<p>The special case of right-censored data is implemented by dove2() in the 
DOVE package available through CRAN.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An S3 object of class iDOVE containing a list with elements
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>call</code></td>
<td>
<p>The unevaluated call.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>changePts</code></td>
<td>
<p>The changePts of the analysis.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>covariates</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix containing the estimated (log) hazard ratio of
each covariate, together with the estimated standard error, the 95%
confidence intervals, and the two-sided p-value for testing no covariates
effect. NA if only an intercept is given as the right hand side in 
input formula.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vaccine</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list containing one or three elements, depending on the 
value of constantVE. 
If constantVE = TRUE, the only element is named 'VE' and is a vector 
containing the estimate of constant VE, its standard error estimate, 
and the 95% confidence interval.
If constantVE = FALSE, three matrices are returned. The first matrix 
named 'VE_a' contains the estimates of the VE in reducing the attack 
rate at all time points given in timePts, together with the 95%
confidence intervals. The second matrix named 'VE_h' contains the 
estimates of the VE in reducing the hazard rate at timePts. 
The third matrix named 'VE_period' contains the estimates of VE in
reducing the attack rate over successive time periods according to
timePts, together with the 95% confidence intervals.</p>
