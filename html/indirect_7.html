<h2>indirect: A package for assisting indirect elicitation of priors for generalised linear models.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>indirect</code> package provides three categories of functions: elicitation
functions, fitting functions and visualisation functions.
</p>


<h3>Elicitation functions</h3>

<p>These are the functions that are used to 
record expert opinion. This is where edits will be made and so on. The key 
function is <code>designLink</code>, which defines a list object that contains
information about the design and elicitation. The elicitations are recorded and updated
via function <code>elicitPt</code>.
</p>


<h3>Fitting functions</h3>

<p>These are generally helper functions except for the function 
<code>muSigma</code> that is used for estimating the mean vector and covariance 
matrix of the unknown coefficients for the multivariate normal prior. Helper functions 
include <code>mV</code> for the elicited moments of conditional means priors.
</p>


<h3>Visualisation functions</h3>

<p>These are functions for visualisation. The
core function is <code>plotDesignPoint</code>.
</p>
