<h2>Calculate SD subtypes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function <code>sd_measures</code> produces SD subtype values in a tibble object
with a row for each subject and columns corresponding to id followed by
each SD subtype.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sd_measures(data,dt0 = NULL, inter_gap = 45, tz = "")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>DataFrame object with column names "id", "time", and "gl".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dt0</code></td>
<td>
<p>The time frequency for interpolation in minutes, the default will match the CGM meter's frequency (e.g. 5 min for Dexcom).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inter_gap</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum allowable gap (in minutes) for interpolation. The values will not be interpolated between the glucose measurements that are more than inter_gap minutes apart. The default value is 45 min.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tz</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string specifying the time zone to be used. System-specific (see <code>as.POSIXct</code>), but " " is the current time zone, and "GMT" is UTC (Universal Time, Coordinated). Invalid values are most commonly treated as UTC, on some platforms with a warning.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A tibble object with 1 row for each subject, a column for subject id and
a column for each SD subtype values is returned.
</p>
<p>Missing values will be linearly interpolated when close enough to non-missing values.

<ol>
<li>
<p> SDw - vertical within days:
</p>
<p>Calculated by first taking the standard deviation of each day's glucose measurements,
then taking the mean of all the standard deviations. That is, for d
days we compute <code class="reqn">SD_1 ... SD_d</code> daily standard deviations and calculate
<code class="reqn">1/d * \sum [(SD_i)]</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> SDhhmm - between time points:
</p>
<p>Also known as SDhh:mm. Calculated by taking the mean glucose values at each time point in the grid across days,
and taking the standard deviation of those mans. That is, for t time points
we compute <code class="reqn">X_t</code> means for each time point and then compute <code class="reqn">SD([X_1, X_2, ... X_t])</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> SDwsh - within series:
</p>
<p>Also known as SDws h. Calculated by taking the hour-long intervals starting at every point in the interpolated
grid, computing the standard deviation of the points in each hour-long interval, and then
finding the mean of those standard deviations. That is, for n time points compute
<code class="reqn">SD_1 ... SD_n</code>, where <code class="reqn">SD_i</code> is the standard deviation of the glucose values <code class="reqn">[X_i, X_{i+1}, ... X_{i+k}]</code>
corresponding to hour-long window starting at observation <code class="reqn">X_i</code>, the number of observations in the window k depends on CGM meter frequency. Then, take
<code class="reqn">1/n * \sum [(SD_i)]</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> SDdm - horizontal sd:
</p>
<p>Calculated by taking the daily mean glucose values, and then taking the standard deviation
of those daily means. That is, for d days we take <code class="reqn">X_1 ... X_d</code> daily means, and then compute
<code class="reqn">SD([X_1, X_2, ... X_d])</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> SDb -  between days, within timepoints:
</p>
<p>Calculated by taking the standard deviation of the glucose values across days for each time point,
and then taking the mean of those standard deviations.
That is, for t time points take <code class="reqn">SD_1 ... SD_t</code> standard deviations, and then compute
<code class="reqn">1/t * \sum[(SD_i)]</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> SDbdm - between days, within timepoints, corrected for changes in daily means:
</p>
<p>Also known as SDb // dm. Calculated by subtracting the daily mean from each glucose value, then taking the standard deviation
of the corrected glucose values across days for each time point, and then taking the mean of those
standard deviations.
That is, for t time points take <code class="reqn">SD_1 ... SD_t</code> standard deviations, and then compute
<code class="reqn">1/t * \sum[(SD_i)]</code>. where <code class="reqn">SD_i</code> is the standard deviation of d daily values at the
1st time point, where each value is the dth measurement for the ith time point subtracted by
the mean of all glucose values for day d.
