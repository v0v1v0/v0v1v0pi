<h2>P-values of ICC(2,1) under Model 2 with subject-rater interaction, for 6 specific null values.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function computes 6 p-values for the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) used as a measure of inter-rater reliability
under the random factorial ANOVA model (Model 2) with subject-rater interaction. Each of the 6 p-values is associated with one
of the null values 0,0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pval.ICC2r.inter(dfra)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dfra</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is a data frame containing 3 columns or more.  The first column contains subject numbers (there could be duplicates
if a subject was assigned multiple ratings) and each of the remaining columns is associated with a particular rater and contains its
numeric ratings.</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns a vector containing 6 p-values associated with the 6 null values 0,0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9.
