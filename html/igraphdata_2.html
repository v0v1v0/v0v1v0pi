<h2>Enron Email Network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An Enron email dataset has been made public by the U.S. Department of Justice.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">enron
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A directed <code>igraph</code> graph object.
</p>
<p>Graph attributes: </p>

<ul>
<li> <p>‘LDC_names’ The names of the 32 LDC catagories the emails
are classfied into by Michael W. Berry
(<a href="http://www.cis.jhu.edu/~parky/Enron/Anno_Topic_exp_LDC.pdf">http://www.cis.jhu.edu/~parky/Enron/Anno_Topic_exp_LDC.pdf</a>)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘LDC_desc’ Longer descriptions of the 32 LDC
categories.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘Citation’ Additionally, see also the references below.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘name’
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Vertex attributes: </p>

<ul>
<li> <p>‘Email’ Email address.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘Name’ Real name.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘Note’ E.g. position at Enron.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Edge attributes: </p>

<ul>
<li> <p>‘Time’ When the email was sent. Note that some time
labels are from 1979, these are certainly wrong and you might want
to remove them before analyses that include time.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘Reciptype’ Recipient type, ‘to’, ‘cc’ or
‘bcc’.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘Topic’ Assigned based on 3-means clustering of
randomly selected 3,120 out of all 125,409 messages, then NN
classification for the whole corpus. Note that topic 0 means an
outlier, e.g., too few words or all meaningless numbers in the
message body.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘LDC_topic’ Assigned based on Michael W. Berry's 2001
“Annotated (by Topic) Enron Email Data Set.”
(<a href="http://www.cis.jhu.edu/~parky/Enron/Anno_Topic_exp_LDC.pdf">http://www.cis.jhu.edu/~parky/Enron/Anno_Topic_exp_LDC.pdf</a>)
There are 32 topics. Topic "0" means an outlier, e.g., too few words
or all meaningless numbers in the message body, etc. Topic "-1"
means there is no matching topic.
