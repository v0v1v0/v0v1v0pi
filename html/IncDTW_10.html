<h2>
Accelerometer: drink a glass, walk, brush teeth.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>3-dimensional acceleration time series recorded during the activities of walking, drinking a glass or brushing teeth.

</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("drink_glass")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list of matrices, where each matrix has 3 columns (x, y, and z axis of the accelerometer). The number of rows differ. 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>list of 3-dimensional time series stored as matrix. The data is recorded with 32Hz. The data is z-scaled (z-normalized).
