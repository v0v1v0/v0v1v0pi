<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Test for changes in the level of statistical significance resulting from the deletion of potentially influential observations</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sigtest(estex, test = 1.96, parameters = 0, sort = FALSE, to.sort = NA)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>estex</code></td>
<td>
<p>Object of class 'estex', as returned from the <code>influence</code> function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>test</code></td>
<td>
<p>Value of the test statistic against which statistical significance is to be evaluated</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parameters</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector specifying the parameter(s) of which the significance is to be evaluated. If left unspecified, all parameters of the model are evaluated</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sort</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specify whether the output should be sorted on the (absolute) magnitude of the test statistic after deletion of potentially influential cases</p>
</td>

<p>If <code>sort==true</code>, the variable on which to sort the output needs to be be specified</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>"sigtest"</code> function tests whether excluding the influence of a single case changes the statistical significance of any or more variables in the model. This test of significance is based on the test statistic provided by the <span class="pkg">lme4</span> package. The nature of this statistic varies between different distributional families in the generalized mixed effects models. For instance, the t-statistic is related to a normal distribution while the z-statistic is related  to binomial distributions. 
</p>
<p>For each of the cases that are evaluated, the test statistic of each variable is compared to a test-value specified by the user. For the purpose of this test, the parameter is regarded to statistically significant if the test statistic of the model exceeds the specified value. The <code>"sigtest"</code> function reports for each variable the test statistic after deletion of each evaluated case, whether or not this updated test statistic results in statistical significance based on the user-specified value, and whether or not this new statistical significance differs from the significance in the original model. So, in other words, if a parameter was statistically significant in the original model, but is not longer significant after the deletion of a specific case from the model, this is indicated by the output of the <code>"sigtest"</code> function. It is also indicated when an estimate was not significant originally, but reached statistical significance after deletion of a specific case. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a list. For each variable in the original model that was evaluated, this list contains a matrix showing the test statistic from the original model (column 1), the test statistic after a potentially influential case was excluded from the model (column 2) and the result (TRUE / FALSE) of the test whether statistical significance changed as a result from deletion of (potentially) influential cases.</p>
