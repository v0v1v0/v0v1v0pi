<h2>Cross-covariance in two spatial dimensions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function efficiently computes two dimensional cross-covariance of two
equal dimensioned matrices of real numbers using efficient discrete fast
Fourier trasforms.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Xcov2D(mat1, mat2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mat1</code></td>
<td>
<p>a real valued matrix</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mat2</code></td>
<td>
<p>a real valued matrix of equal dimension to mat1</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The algorithm first pads each matrix with zeros so that the outer edges of
the matrices do not interact with one another due to the circular nature of
the discrete fast Fourier transform. Cross-covariance calculations require
computation of the complex conjugate of one of the two imput matrices.
Assuming all of it's elements are real, computing the complex conjugate is
equivalent to flipping the matrix in the horizontal and vertical directions.
Then to compute cross-covariance, the first matrix is convolved with the
flipped second matrix as described in the convolution theorem.
</p>
<p>This function is called by the main functions that compute displacement
fields and vector fields and is included here primarily for demonstration
purposes. Specifically, the method for computing the magnitude and direction
of shifts is demonstrated in the examples.
</p>
<p>The shift that produces the maximum cross-covariance between the two input
matrices can be obtained by finding the row and column indices associated
with the maximum cross-covariance. The shift in each direction is obtained by
subracting one plus the half the dimension of the output matrix (the same for
rows and columns) from the row and column values that are associated with the
maximum cross-covariance as demonstrated in the examples below. Note that
shifts to the right and up are denoted with positive numbers and shifts to
the left and down are denoted by negative numbers. This is contrary to some
conventions but efficient for producing vector fields. For more details on
cross-covariance see

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a real valued matrix showing cross-covariance in each direction

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">matrix(c(1:6, rep(0, 3)), nrow = 3); matrix(c(rep(0, 3), 1:6), nrow = 3)
dim(Xcov2D(matrix(c(1:6, rep(0, 3)), nrow = 3),
    matrix(c(rep(0, 3), 1:6), nrow = 3)))
ICvectorfields::GetRowCol(
    which.max(Xcov2D(matrix(c(1:6, rep(0, 3)), nrow = 3),
        matrix(c(rep(0, 3), 1:6), nrow = 3))),
    dim1 = dim(Xcov2D(matrix(c(1:6, rep(0, 3)), nrow = 3),
        matrix(c(rep(0, 3), 1:6), nrow = 3)))[1],
    dim2 = dim(Xcov2D(matrix(c(1:6, rep(0, 3)), nrow = 3),
        matrix(c(rep(0, 3), 1:6), nrow = 3)))[2]
        )
# This implies that the shift is 6 - (10/2 + 1) in the vertical
# direction and 7 - (10/2 + 1) in the horizonatal direction.
