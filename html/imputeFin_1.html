<h2>imputeFin: Imputation of Financial Time Series with Missing Values.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Missing values often occur in financial data due to a variety 
of reasons (errors in the collection process or in the processing stage, 
lack of asset liquidity, lack of reporting of funds, etc.). However, 
most data analysis methods expect complete data and cannot be employed 
with missing values. One convenient way to deal with this issue without 
having to redesign the data analysis method is to impute the missing 
values. This package provides an efficient way to impute the missing 
values based on modeling the time series with a random walk or an 
autoregressive (AR) model, convenient to model log-prices and log-volumes 
in financial data. In the current version, the imputation is 
univariate-based (so no asset correlation is used). In addition,
outliers can be detected and removed.
