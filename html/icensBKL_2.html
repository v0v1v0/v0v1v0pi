<h2>AIDS Clinical Trial ACTG 181</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol ACTG 181 was a natural history
substudy of a comparative trial of three anti-pneumocystis drugs.
Patients were followed for shedding of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in urine
and blood samples, and for colonization of mycobacterium avium complex
(MAC) in the sputum and stool. Subjects were screened for CMV in the
urine every 4 weeks and in the blood every 12 weeks. Subjects were
screened for MAC every 12 weeks. Many patients missed several of the
prescheduled clinic visits, and returned with new laboratory
indications for CMV or MAC. Thus, their times until first CMV shedding
or MAC colonization are censored into intervals of time when the
missed clinic visits occurred. However, for the current analysis,
visit times were rounded to the closest quarter because they are of
practical interest to physicians in that they correspond to standard clinic schedules.
Only 204 of the 232 subjects in the study who were tested for CMV
shedding and MAC colonization at least once during the trial, and did
not have a prior CMV or MAC diagnosis are included in the data base.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(aidsCT)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>a data frame with 204 rows and the following variables
</p>

<dl>
<dt>L.CMV</dt>
<dd>
<p>left (lower) limit of interval (L.CMV, R.CMV] that
contains time of CMV shedding (months). It is <code>NA</code> if the time of CMV
shedding is left-censored at <code>R.CMV</code>.      
</p>
</dd>
<dt>R.CMV</dt>
<dd>
<p>right (upper) limit of interval (L.CMV, R.CMV] that
contains time of CMV shedding (months). It is <code>NA</code> if the time of CMV
shedding is right-censored at <code>L.CMV</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>L.MAC</dt>
<dd>
<p>left (lower) limit of interval (L.MAC, R.MAC] that
contains time of MAC colonization (months). It is <code>NA</code> if the
time of MAC colonization is left-censored at <code>R.MAC</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>R.MAC</dt>
<dd>
<p>right (upper) limit of interval (L.MAC, R.MAC] that
contains time of MAC colonization (months). It is <code>NA</code> if the
time of MAC colonization is right-censored at <code>L.MAC</code>.
</p>
</dd>
