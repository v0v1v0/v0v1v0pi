<h2>Data for the High Uncertainty numerical example of Obenchain et al. (2005)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data are from two arms of a double-blind clinical trial in which 91 patients
were randomized to the SNRI duloxetine 80 mg/d (40 mg BID) and 87 patients were randomized to
the SSRI paroxetine 20 mg/d for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).  Missing-data-
imputation and sensitivity-analyses were needed to make meaningful cost-effectiveness
comparisons in this study.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(dulxparx)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame of 3 variables on 178 patients; no NAs.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>idb</dt>
<dd>
<p>This measure of overall effectiveness is <em>integrated decrease in HAMD-17
score from baseline to endpoint</em>, Hamilton (1967).  This is a (signed) area-under-the-curve
measure with larger values more favorable.  Missing values were imputed via the MMRM models
reported in Goldstein et al. (2004).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>ru</dt>
<dd>
<p>Patient self-reported health-care resource utilization above and beyond that
provided within study protocol was collected using the Resource Utilization Survey,
Copley-Merriman et al. (1992), with published 1998 dollars-per-unit costs, Schoenbaum et al. (2001),
rounded to the nearest 50 dollars.  Dollars/week were then calculated by multiplying (total accumulated
cost) for a patient by 7 and dividing by the (total days of cost accumulation) for that
patient.  For patients who discontinued early, this is Average-Value-Carried-Forward
imputation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>dulx</dt>
<dd>
<p>Treatment indicator variable. dulx = 1 implies receipt of duloxetine 80 mg/d
(40 mg BID). dulx = 0 implies receipt of paroxetine 20 mg/d.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
