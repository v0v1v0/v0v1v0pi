<h2>influenceR: Software tools to quantify structural importance of nodes in a network.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The influenceR package includes functions to quantify the structural
importance of nodes in a network. Algorithms include Betweenness Centrality,
Bridging, Constraint Index, Effective Network Size, and Key Players.
Currently, algorithms are only guaranteed to work on undirected graphs; work
on directed graphs is in progress. These functions run on graph objects from
the igraph package.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In addition to igraph, this package makes use of the SNAP framework for a
high-performance graph data structure and an OpenMP-parallelized
implementation of Betweenness Centrality. See

<h3>Funding</h3>

<p>Development of this software package was supported by NIH grant R01 DA033875.
