<h2>inpdfr: A package to analyse PDF Files Using Ecological Tools.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The inpdfr package allows analysing and comparing PDF/TXT documents using both
classical text mining tools and those from theoretical ecolgy. In the later,
words are considered as species and documents as communities, therefore
allowing analysis at the community and metacommunity levels.
The inpdfr package provides three cathegories of functions:
functions to extract and process text into a word-occurrence data.frame,
functions to analyse the word-occurrence data.frame with standard and ecological tools, and
functions to use inpdfr through a Gtk2 Graphical User Interface (GitHub version only).
