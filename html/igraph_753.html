<h2>Generate random graphs with a given degree sequence</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>It is often useful to create a graph with given vertex degrees. This function
creates such a graph in a randomized manner.

  out.deg,
  in.deg = NULL,
  method = c("configuration", "vl", "fast.heur.simple", "configuration.simple",
    "edge.switching.simple")
)

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>out.deg</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector, the sequence of degrees (for undirected
graphs) or out-degrees (for directed graphs). For undirected graphs its sum

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The “configuration” method (formerly called "simple") implements the
configuration model. For undirected graphs, it puts all vertex IDs in a bag
such that the multiplicity of a vertex in the bag is the same as its degree.
Then it draws pairs from the bag until the bag becomes empty. This method may
generate both loop (self) edges and multiple edges. For directed graphs,
the algorithm is basically the same, but two separate bags are used
for the in- and out-degrees. Undirected graphs are generated
with probability proportional to <code class="reqn">(\prod_{i&lt;j} A_{ij} ! \prod_i A_{ii} !!)^{-1}</code>,
where A denotes the adjacency matrix and !! denotes the double factorial.
Here A is assumed to have twice the number of self-loops on its diagonal.
The corresponding expression for directed graphs is <code class="reqn">(\prod_{i,j} A_{ij}!)^{-1}</code>.
Thus the probability of all simple graphs
(which only have 0s and 1s in the adjacency matrix)
is the same, while that of non-simple ones depends on their edge and
self-loop multiplicities.
</p>
<p>The “fast.heur.simple” method (formerly called "simple.no.multiple")
generates simple graphs.
It is similar to “configuration” but tries to avoid multiple and
loop edges and restarts the generation from scratch if it gets stuck.
It can generate all simple realizations of a degree sequence,
but it is not guaranteed to sample them uniformly.
This method is relatively fast and it will eventually succeed
if the provided degree sequence is graphical, but there is no upper bound on
the number of iterations.
</p>
<p>The “configuration.simple” method (formerly called "simple.no.multiple.uniform")
is
identical to “configuration”, but if the generated graph is not simple,
it rejects it and re-starts the generation.
It generates all simple graphs with the same probability.
</p>
<p>The “vl” method samples undirected connected graphs approximately uniformly.
It is a Monte Carlo method based on degree-preserving edge switches.
This generator should be favoured if undirected and connected graphs are to be
generated and execution time is not a concern. igraph uses
the original implementation of Fabien Viger; for the algorithm, see
<a href="https://www-complexnetworks.lip6.fr/~latapy/FV/generation.html">https://www-complexnetworks.lip6.fr/~latapy/FV/generation.html</a>
and the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0502085">https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0502085</a>.
</p>
<p>The “edge.switching.simple” is an MCMC sampler based on
degree-preserving edge switches. It generates simple undirected or directed graphs.
