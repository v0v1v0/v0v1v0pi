<h2>Eastern Snake River Plain Boundary</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Boundary of the eastern Snake River Plain (ESPR), Idaho.
The ESPR is a structural basin that extends about 200 miles in a northeast direction and is 50-70 miles wide.
The basin is bounded by faults on the northwest and by down warping and faulting on the southeast.
It has been filled with basaltic lava flows interbedded with terrestrial sediments.
The combination of basaltic rock and sedimentary deposits forms the ESRP aquifer,
which is the primary source of groundwater in the basin

<dl>
<dt><code>geometry</code></dt>
<dd>

<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The ESPR boundary was digitized from 7.5' quads within and in the vicinity of the Idaho
National Laboratory by the U.S. Geological Survey
<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/idaho-water-science-center/science/idaho-national-laboratory-project-office">Idaho National Laboratory Project Office</a>
The digitized polygons were made into shapefiles and converted into GeoJSON files.
