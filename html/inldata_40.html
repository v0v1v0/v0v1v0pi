<h2>Percolation Ponds</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Percolation ponds in the vicinity of Idaho National Laboratory (INL), eastern Idaho.
Wastewater from facilities at the INL has been and is currently disposed of in percolation (infiltration),
evaporation (lined and unlined), and infiltration ponds.
