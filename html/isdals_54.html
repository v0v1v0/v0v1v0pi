<h2>Drugs in rat's livers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An experiment was undertaken to
investigate the amount of drug present in the liver of a rat. Nineteen
rats were randomly selected, weighed, placed under a light anesthetic,
and given an oral dose of the drug. It was believed that large livers
would absorb more of a given dose than a small liver, so the actual dose
given was approximately determined as 40 mg of the drug per kilogram of
body weight. After a fixed length of time, each rat was sacrificed, the
liver weighed, and the percent dose in the liver was determined.
