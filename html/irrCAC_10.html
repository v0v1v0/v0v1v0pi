<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains data from a reliability experiment where 4 raters identified as Rater1, Rater2, Rater3 and Rater4

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This dataset contains ratings obtained from an experiment where 4 raters classified 14 subjects into 5 
possible categories labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. None of the 4 raters scored all 14 units. Therefore, 
some missing ratings appear in each of the columns associated with the 4 raters.
</p>
<p>Note that only the the 4 last columns are to be used with the functions included in this package.  The first 2
columns only play a descriptive role and are not used in any calculation.
