<h2>Create an igraph graph from a list of edges, or a notable graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated"><img src="../help/figures/lifecycle-deprecated.svg" alt="[Deprecated]"></a>
</p>
<p><code>graph()</code> was renamed to <code>make_graph()</code> to create a more
consistent API.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">graph(
  edges,
  ...,
  n = max(edges),
  isolates = NULL,
  directed = TRUE,
  dir = directed,
  simplify = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>edges</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector defining the edges, the first edge points
from the first element to the second, the second edge from the third
to the fourth, etc. For a numeric vector, these are interpreted
as internal vertex ids. For character vectors, they are interpreted
as vertex names.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, this can be a character scalar, the name of a
notable graph. See Notable graphs below. The name is case
insensitive.
</p>
<p>Starting from igraph 0.8.0, you can also include literals here,
via igraph's formula notation (see <code>graph_from_literal()</code>).
In this case, the first term of the formula has to start with
a ‘<code>~</code>’ character, just like regular formulae in R.
See examples below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>For <code>make_graph()</code>: extra arguments for the case when the
graph is given via a literal, see <code>graph_from_literal()</code>.
For <code>directed_graph()</code> and <code>undirected_graph()</code>:
Passed to <code>make_directed_graph()</code> or <code>make_undirected_graph()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of vertices in the graph. This argument is
ignored (with a warning) if <code>edges</code> are symbolic vertex names. It
is also ignored if there is a bigger vertex id in <code>edges</code>. This
means that for this function it is safe to supply zero here if the
vertex with the largest id is not an isolate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>isolates</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character vector, names of isolate vertices,
for symbolic edge lists. It is ignored for numeric edge lists.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>directed</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to create a directed graph.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dir</code></td>
<td>
<p>It is the same as <code>directed</code>, for compatibility.
Do not give both of them.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>simplify</code></td>
<td>
<p>For graph literals, whether to simplify the graph.</p>
</td>
</tr>
