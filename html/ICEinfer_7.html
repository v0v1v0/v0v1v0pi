<h2>Functions to compute and display ICE Acceptability Curves</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>ICEalice() computes statistics for the VAGR Acceptability Curve and for the
Buckingham ALICE curve.  Plots for the resulting ICEalice object are of two types:
[1] a VAGR curve where the horizontal axis is the Willingness to Pay (WTP) ICE Ratio,
and [2] a monotone ALICE curve where the horizontal axis is the Absolute Value of
the ICE Polar Angle, which varies from +45 degrees to +135 degrees.  Printing an
ICEalice object yields a 13 x 5 table (matrix) of numerical values for Absolute
ICEangle, WTP, VAGR Acceptability, WTA and ALICE acceptability, respectively. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> ICEalice(ICEw)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ICEw</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class ICEwedge.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The VAGR Acceptability Curve displays the fraction of outcomes within the Bootstrap
distribution of ICE Uncertainty that lie below and/or to the right of a rotating
straight line through the origin of the ICE plane.  This straight line starts out
horizontal, representing lambda = WTP = 0, and rotates counter-clockwise until it
becomes vertical, representing lambda = WTP = +Inf. 
</p>
<p>The Buckingham ALICE Curve assumes that lambra is held fixed.  It displays the fraction
of outcomes within the Bootstrap distribution of ICE Uncertainty that lie on or between
a pair of rotating ICE rays (eminating from the ICE origin) with slopes representing
KINKed values of WTP &lt; WTA that always satisfy Obenchain's LINK function, lambda =
sqrt(WTP*WTA), with lambda held fixed.  The right-hand ray for WTP starts out horizontal
and pointing to the right, then rotates counter-clockwise until it is vertical, as in a
VAGR curve.  The left-hand ray for WTA starts out vertical and pointing downwards, then
rotates clockwise until it is horizontal.  Since lambda is held fixed, the slopes of
the rotating rays corresponding to decreasing WTA as WTP increases.  The starting point
of an ALICE curve at an Absolute ICE Angle of 45 degrees always represents the fraction
of outcomes in the Bootstrap Distribution of ICE Uncertainty for which the new treatment
is both less costly AND more effective than the std treatment. The ending point of an
ALICE curve at an Absolute ICE Angle of 135 degrees always represents the fraction of
outcomes in the Bootstrap Distribution of ICE Uncertainty for which the new treatment
is either less costly OR more effective than the std treatment.  The middle point of an
ALICE curve at an Absolute ICE Angle of 90 degrees represents the fraction of outcomes
in the Bootstrap Distribution of ICE Uncertainty falling below and/or to the right of the
straight line through the ICE origin of slope lambda = WTP = WTA.
