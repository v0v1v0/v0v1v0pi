<h2>Read raw data from a variety of common sensors.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Helper function to assist in reading data directly from sensor outputs. Should return a dataframe in correct format
for use with the rest of the <code>iglu</code> package. Assumes all data will be readable with base R <code>read.csv()</code> function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">read_raw_data(
  filename,
  sensor = c("dexcom", "libre", "librepro", "asc", "ipro"),
  id = "filename",
  tz = ""
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>filename</code></td>
<td>
<p>String matching the name of the data to be read. Assumed to be .csv</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sensor</code></td>
<td>
<p><strong>Default: "dexcom".</strong> String naming the type of sensor the data was exported from.
Must be one of "dexcom", "libre", "librepro", "asc", or "ipro".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>id</code></td>
<td>
<p><strong>Default: "filename".</strong> String indicating subject id.
A value of "read" will cause the program to attempt to read the subject id from the file. A value of "filename" will cause the
program to use the basename of the filename (i.e. filename without any directory information) with .csv removed, as subject id.
A value of "default" will cause the program to use whichever of "read" or "filename" that is default for that specific sensor.
Any other string will be treated as the unique id for the entire file.
</p>
<p>Note the asc reader currently does not support id="read"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tz</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string specifying the time zone to be used. System-specific (see <code>as.POSIXct</code>), but " " is the current time zone, and "GMT" is UTC (Universal Time, Coordinated). Invalid values are most commonly treated as UTC, on some platforms with a warning.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A DataFrame object with the columns "id", "time" and "gl" and one row per reading will be returned. For the libre reader,
if the phrase "mmol/l" is found in the column names, the glucose values will be multiplied by 18.
</p>
<p>Assumes .csv format for all data.
</p>
<p>Sensor formats change with ongoing development, so these functions may become deprecated.

</p>
<p>Note: this function is heavily derived from the readers avaiable in the cgmanalysis package's <code>cleandata</code> function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe containing the data read from the named file.
