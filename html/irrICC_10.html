<h2>Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) under ANOVA Model 1A.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This ICC is associated with the one-factor ANOVA model where each subject could be rated by a different group of raters. This ICC represents
a measure of inter-rater reliability among all raters involved in the experiment.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">icc1a.fn(ratings)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ratings</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is a data frame containing 3 columns or more.  The first column contains subject numbers (there could be duplicates
if a subject was assigned multiple ratings) and each of the remaining columns is associated with a particular rater and contains its
numeric ratings.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns a list containing the following 9 values:
1. sig2s: the subject variance component. 2. sig2e: the error variance component. 3. icc1a: the ICC/inter-rater reliability coefficient
4. n: the number of subjects. 5. r: the number of raters. 6. max.rep: the maximum number of ratings per subject. 7. min.rep: the minimum
number of ratings per subjects. 8. M: the total number of ratings for all subjects and raters. 9. ov.mean: the overall mean rating.
