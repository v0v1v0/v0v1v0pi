<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">shinyIstat()
</code></pre>

</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Calling a ShinyApp equals to calling a R function. For this reason, once called shinyIstat(), R will be busy processing it until the app will be closed. As a consequence, all other R functionalities can be processed only when the app is closed.
