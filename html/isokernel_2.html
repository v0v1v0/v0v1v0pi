<h2>Calculate pairwise Isolation Kernel Similarity for a given dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Isolation kernel is a data dependent kernel measure that is
adaptive to local data distribution and has more flexibility in capturing
the characteristics of the local data distribution. It has been shown promising
performance on density and distance-based classification and clustering problems.
</p>
<p>This version uses Voronoi diagrams to split the data space and calculate Isolation
kernel Similarity, following the paper: Qin, X., Ting, K.M., Zhu, Y. and Lee,
V.C., 2019, July. Nearest-neighbour-induced isolation similarity and its impact
on density-based clustering. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial
Intelligence (Vol. 33, pp. 4755-4762). Based on this implementation, the higher
the probability of two data points (x and y) falling into the same cell of a Voronoi
diagram, the more the similar between the two points. Therefore, Isolation kernel
is adaptive to the local density, i.e., two points are less likely to fall into
the same cell unless they are very close in a dense region, because more cells are
generated in the dense region than in the sparse region.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">IKSimilarity(data, Sdata = data, psi = 64, t = 200)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dataset used for applying Isolation kernel function. The data is a
n by d matrix, where n is the data size, d is the dimensionality.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Sdata</code></td>
<td>
<p>The dataset use for generating Voronoi diagrams, it can be the same
as the input data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>psi</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of cells in each Voronoi diagram, it should be large
if there are more clusters or more complex structures in the data.
It could be [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of Voronoi diagrams, the higher the more stable the result</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A n by n similarity matrix based on Isolation kernel. The similarity matrix
is the inner products between all pairs of data in the feature space. The feature
vectors in the Isolation kernel space are built by IKFeature function.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">### 1. calculate the pairwise Isolation kernel similarity in the iris dataset
library(isokernel)
df &lt;- iris
SimMatrix &lt;- IKSimilarity(data=df[,1:4],psi=4,t=200)

### 2. calculate the Isolation kernel similarity between A and B
library(isokernel)
A &lt;- iris[1:10,1:4]
B &lt;- iris[21:40,1:4]
S &lt;- rbind(A,B)
t &lt;- 200
FA &lt;- IKFeature(A,S,psi=4,t=200) # Kernel space features for A
FB &lt;- IKFeature(B,S,psi=4,t=200) # Kernel space features for B
SimAB &lt;- FA%*%t(as.matrix(FB))/t  # dot product on FA and FB
