<h2>Automated scoring of incubation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is the core algorithm of <code>incR</code> and classifies time points as 1's or 0's depending on
whether or not the incubating individual is considered to be on the eggs. 
The algorithm
uses night variation to daily calibrate itself to temperature variation when the incubating
individual is assumed to be on the eggs. 
A major assumption of this algorithm is that
there is a period of time in which temperature can be assumed to be constant or
representative of time windows of constant incubation. This time window is defined by
two arguments: <code>lower.time</code> and <code>upper.time</code>. The function is optimised to work using
a data frame produced by <code>incRprep</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">incRscan(
  data,
  temp.name,
  lower.time,
  upper.time,
  sensitivity,
  temp.diff,
  temp.diff.threshold,
  maxNightVariation,
  env.temp
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>data frame for analysis. It must contained four columns named as follow:
<code>date</code>, <code>temp1</code>, <code>dec_time</code> and <code>index</code>, where <code>temp1</code> is the difference between
the <em>ith</em> and  <em>i-1th</em> temperature recordings; <code>dec_time</code> is time in
decimal hours; and <code>index</code> is a running number from 1 to <em>N</em>, <em>N</em> being the 
total number of observations. <code>incRprep</code> returns a data frame with
these variables and the correct names, ready to be passed through <code>incRscan</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>temp.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character object) name of the column containing temperature data 
in <code>data</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lower.time</code></td>
<td>
<p>lower limit of time window for calibration (numeric).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>upper.time</code></td>
<td>
<p>upper limit of time window for calibration (numeric).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sensitivity</code></td>
<td>
<p>ratio of reduction in temperature threshold. When nest temperature
does not drop close to environmental temperatures, this value can be kept to 1. If 
nest temperature follows environmental temperature at any point, 
then adjustment of this value may
be required to detect short on/off-bouts at lower nest temperatures (see details).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>temp.diff</code></td>
<td>
<p>deprecated. Use temp.diff.threshold.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>temp.diff.threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>threshold for temperature difference between <code>env.temp</code> and an observation which
triggers the sensitivity parameter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxNightVariation</code></td>
<td>
<p>maximum temperature variation between two consecutive points
within the calibrating window that is considered normal of this period. 
If this variation value is surpassed, the
calibrating window is discarded and a previous night is used for calibration.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>env.temp</code></td>

<p>name of a column containing environmental temperatures.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a list with two objects. The first object, named <code>incRscan_data</code>, is the original
data frame with an extra column named 'incR_score'. This variable is formed by 1's and 0's,
representing whether the incubating individual is inside (1) or outside the nest (0).
</p>
<p>The second object, named <code>incRscan_threshold</code>, is a data frame with one day per row. Four columns tell the user
the thresholds employed to calculate the 'incR_score' column. A fifth column accounts
for the ratio between temperature variation in the calibrating window and the variation in temperature 
between 11am and 3pm for each day morning. The lower this value the more clear the pattern between night 
and day variation and, therefore, stronger the signal in the data. 
This value may serve the user as an indication of the signal / noise ratio in the analysed
data set.
