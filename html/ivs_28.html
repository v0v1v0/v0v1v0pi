<h2>Diff a vector to create an interval vector</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>iv_diff()</code> is a convenient way to generate an iv from a preexisting vector,
as long as that vector is in strictly increasing order. It returns an iv
that is 1 element shorter than <code>x</code> (unless <code>x</code> is already empty).
</p>
<p>It is particularly useful for creating an iv column from an existing column
inside of <code>dplyr::mutate()</code>, but requires you to explicitly handle padding
in that case, see the examples.
</p>
<p>Missing values are allowed, and will be propagated to each side of the
resulting interval after applying the diff.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">iv_diff(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠[vector]⁠</code>
</p>
<p>A vector in strictly increasing order.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>iv_diff()</code> is inspired by <code>diff()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An iv using <code>x</code> as the inner type, with size equal to
<code>max(0L, vec_size(x) - 1L)</code>.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">x &lt;- as.Date("2019-01-01") + c(0, 5, 7, 10, 19)
x

# Notice how the boundaries don't overlap, because the closing `)` aligns
# with an opening `[`.
iv_diff(x)

# Like `iv()`, missing values propagate to both boundaries of the interval.
# Before missing value propagation was applied, it looked like this:
# [1, NA), [NA, 2), [2, 3)
x &lt;- c(1, NA, 2, 3)
iv_diff(x)

# Values in `x` must be in strictly increasing order to generate a valid
# interval vector
x &lt;- c(1, 0, 2, 2)
try(iv_diff(x))

x &lt;- c(1, NA, 0)
try(iv_diff(x))

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Use with `mutate()`

library(dplyr)

# `iv_diff()` is useful for converting a pre-existing column into an interval
# vector, but you'll need to apply padding to ensure that the size of the
# diff-ed result is the same as the number of rows in your data frame. There
# are two main ways to pad, which are explored below.
df &lt;- tibble(x = c(1, 3, 6))

# Pad with a known lower/upper bound
df %&gt;% mutate(iv = iv_diff(c(0, x)))
df %&gt;% mutate(iv = iv_diff(c(x, Inf)))

# Pad with a missing value, which results in a fully missing interval
df %&gt;% mutate(iv = iv_diff(c(NA, x)))
df %&gt;% mutate(iv = iv_diff(c(x, NA)))
