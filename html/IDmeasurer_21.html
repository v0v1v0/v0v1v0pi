<p>Corncrake calls were recorded at three sites in Poland and one in the Czech
Republic Recordings were made during the corncrake breeding season, from 8 to
30 July, in 2011 and in 2012. Males were recorded when calling spontaneously,
in favourable conditions, at night (from 22.00 to 03.30, local time) from a
distance of ca. 5-10 m. The original dataset comprised 104 males with 10
calls measured from each male.<br><br>
Seven variables were selected to measure duration of the first syllable of
the call and its basic spectral parameters of each first syllable of the call
like the peak frequency, distribution of frequency amplitudes within
spectrum, and range of the frequencies (minimum and maximum). Additionally,
the duration of the call was measured. Variables were extracted in SASLab Pro
by Avisoft.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">CCspec
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 330 rows and 8 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>id</dt>
<dd>
<p>factor, identity code of an individual emitting the call</p>
</dd>
<dt>dur</dt>
<dd>
<p>duration of the call, in seconds</p>
</dd>
<dt>df</dt>
<dd>
<p>frequency of maximum amplitude within the spectrum - peak frequency, in Hertz</p>
</dd>
<dt>minf, maxf</dt>
<dd>
<p>minimum and maximum fequency at -25dB relative to the call peak amplitude, in Hertz</p>
</dd>
<dt>q25, q50, q75</dt>
<dd>
<p>frequencies at the three quartiles of amplitude
distribution; frequencies below which lie 25, 50 and 75 percent of the energy of
the call, respectively, in Hertz</p>
</dd>
