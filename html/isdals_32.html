<h2>Enzyme experiment with inhibitors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data comes from an enzyme experiment with inhibitors. The enzyme acts on a substrate that was tested in six concentrations between 10 micro M and 600 micro M. Three concentrations of the inhibitor were tested, namely 0 (controls), 50 micro M and 100 micro M. There were two replicates for each combination yielding a total of 36 observations of reaction rate.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(inhibitor)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 36 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
