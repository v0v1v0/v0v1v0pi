<h2>Store and retrieve R objects in the database</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A user can elect to store R objects in a database table rather than storing them in a workstation file system. 
This makes it easier for users to share objects, and simplifies backup tasks.
</p>
<p>Each user has two R object storage tables:
</p>
  
<ul>
<li>
<p> A private table, for objects that other users are not to be able to access
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A public table, for objects that other users are to be able to read
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the <code>ida.list</code> function to create a pointer to either of your own R object storage tables, 
or to the public R object storage table of another user. You can then use the pointer to store 
objects in or retrieve objects from the corresponding table. (If the table belongs to another user 
you can only retrieve objects from it, not store objects in it.)
</p>
<p>Please note that whether public tables might not have effect on databases that do not allow to set
permissions accordingly, for instance, in multi-tenant environments. To enable the sharing of objects in DB2,
an administrator needs to first create a role names R_USERS_PUBLIC and assign it to all users who
should be allowed to share objects. For Db2, roles will be setup automatically if in the scope of the plan.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ida.list(type='public',user=NULL) 
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>The type (private or public) of the table. You can specify 'private' only if <code>user</code> is NULL  
or is set explicitly to your own user ID.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>user</code></td>
<td>
<p>The user ID of the owner of the R object storage table. If set to NULL, the user ID is that of the current user. The user ID is treated case-sensitive.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A pointer to an R object storage table.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# Create a pointer to the private R object storage table of the current user.
myPrivateObjects &lt;- ida.list(type='private')

# Use the pointer created in the previous example to store a series of numbers in an object with 
# the name 'series100' in the private R object storage table of the current user.
myPrivateObjects['series100'] &lt;- 1:100

# Retrieve the object with the name 'series100' from the 
# private R object storage table of the current user.
x &lt;- myPrivateObjects['series100']

# Delete the object with name 'series100' from the 
# private R object storage table of the current user.

myPrivateObjects['series100'] &lt;- NULL

# List all objects in the private R object storage table of the current user.
names(myPrivateObjects)

# Return the number of objects in the private R object storage table of the current user.
length(myPrivateObjects)

# Create a pointer to the public R object storage table of the current user.
myPublicObjects &lt;- ida.list(type="public")


## End(Not run)
