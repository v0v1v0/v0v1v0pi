<h2>Input Manual Nested</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generates manual data input for a nested model with several tests.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">input_manual_nested(
  construct_name,
  test_names,
  items_per_test,
  item_names,
  construct_loadings,
  test_loadings,
  correlation_matrix
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>construct_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>character; the name of the overall construct.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>test_names</code></td>
<td>
<p>character; the names of the tests in correct order.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>items_per_test</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer; number of items per test in correct order
(determined by test_names), if all tests have the same number of items a
single number can be used, e.g. 10 instead of c(10, 10, 10).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>item_names</code></td>
<td>
<p>character or integer; the names of the items in correct
order (determined by test_names).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>construct_loadings</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer; vector of the factor loadings from the
single factor model of the construct in correct order (determined by
item_names).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>test_loadings</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer; vector of the factor loadings on the test
factors from the group factor model in correct order (determined by
item_names).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>correlation_matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>matrix containing the latent correlations between
tests, pay attention to the order of rows and columns, which is determined
by test_names.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Pay attention to the order of tests and items, it has to be coherent
throughout the whole data. test_names and items_per_test determine which
test is listed first and how many items are listed for that test.
item_names, construct_loadings and test_loadings have to match that order.
The correlation matrix uses the order in test_names for rows and columns.
</p>
<p>This function only lists the name of the tests in output$tests. For each of
those tests, the data on the facets needs to be added using
<code>input_manual_simple</code>. Every test for which you do not provide
this data will be treated as having no facets.
</p>
<p>Visually inspect the returned object before continuing with
<code>input_manual_process</code>!
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>list containing "raw" data. The data on the facets of the tests needs
to be added using <code>input_manual_simple</code>. Afterwards, the whole
data needs to be pre-processed using <code>input_manual_process</code>.
</p>
