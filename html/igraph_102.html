<h2>Shortest (directed or undirected) paths between vertices</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated"><img src="../help/figures/lifecycle-deprecated.svg" alt="[Deprecated]"></a>
</p>
<p><code>average.path.length()</code> was renamed to <code>mean_distance()</code> to create a more
consistent API.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">average.path.length(
  graph,
  weights = NULL,
  directed = TRUE,
  unconnected = TRUE,
  details = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The graph to work on.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>Possibly a numeric vector giving edge weights. If this is
<code>NULL</code> and the graph has a <code>weight</code> edge attribute, then the
attribute is used. If this is <code>NA</code> then no weights are used (even if
the graph has a <code>weight</code> attribute). In a weighted graph, the length
of a path is the sum of the weights of its constituent edges.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>directed</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to consider directed paths in directed graphs,
this argument is ignored for undirected graphs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>unconnected</code></td>
<td>
<p>What to do if the graph is unconnected (not
strongly connected if directed paths are considered). If TRUE, only
the lengths of the existing paths are considered and averaged; if
FALSE, the length of the missing paths are considered as having infinite
length, making the mean distance infinite as well.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>details</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to provide additional details in the result.
Functions accepting this argument (like <code>mean_distance()</code>) return
additional information like the number of disconnected vertex pairs in
the result when this parameter is set to <code>TRUE</code>.</p>
