<h2>
Data from three Danish cormorant breeding colonies, 1991-2004
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data were collected during 14 years from 1991 to 2004 at the three Danish cormorant breeding colonies located in the southwestern Kattegat in the inner Danish waters: Vorsø (labelled V), Mågeøerne (M) and Stavns Fjord (S).
</p>
<p>Counts:  The number of occupied nests in each colony was counted each year in early May.
</p>
<p>Resightings: In all colonies, a large number of nestlings were marked with a standard metal ring on one leg and an alphanumeric colored plastic ring on the other leg; in total 12,659 individuals were marked. Resightings of marked individuals at the breeding colonies by trained field workers from towers, hides or from the ground using a telescope were recorded. Resightings were restricted to breeding individuals. Some individuals appear for the first time in the data set as breeders, having been marked as nestlings prior to 1991.

<dd>
<p>matrix of counts of active nests in 3 breeding colonies x 14 years.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ms.ch </dt>
<dd>
<p>a multistate capture history matrix for 12,659 birds x 14 years. The state codes 1-3 index nestlings in colonies V, M and S, respectively, and the state codes 4-6 do the same for the breeders.</p>
