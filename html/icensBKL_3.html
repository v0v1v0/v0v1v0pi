<h2>Cosmetic Data on Breast Cancer Patients</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Breadle et al. (1984a, 1984b) report a retrospective study carried out
to compare the cosmetic effects of radiotherapy alone versus radiotherapy
and adjuvant chemotherapy on women with early breast cancer. 
</p>
<p>Patients were observed initially every 4 to 6 months, but as their
recovery progressed, the interval betwenn visits lengthened.
At each visit, the clinician recorded a measure of breast retraction
on a 3-point scale (none, moderate, severe).
Event of interest was the time to first appearance of moderate or severe breast retraction.
</p>
<p>The subjects in this data were patients who had been treated at
the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy in Boston between 1976 and 1980.
