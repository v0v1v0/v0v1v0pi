<h2>Mean of Squares for Raters (MSR) under ANOVA Model 2 with or without interaction.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function computes the MSR under the random factorial ANOVA model (MOdel 2). It can be used whether
or not the subject-rater interaction is assumed. The MSR is used for calculating confidence intervals and p-values associated
with the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability coefficients under model 2.
