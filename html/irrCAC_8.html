<h2>Distribution of 4 raters by subject and by category, for 14 Subjects that belong to 2 groups "G1" and "G2"</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains rating data in the form of a subject-level distribution of 4 raters by category the subject
was classified into. A total of 4 raters had to classify 14 subjects into one of 5 categories "a", "b", "c", "d", and "e". 
This dataset is different version of the more detailed cac.raw.g1g2 dataset. While cac.raw.g1g2 tells you
about the exact category into which each rater classified all subjects, cac.dist.g1g2 on the other hand, can only tell 
you how many raters classified a given subject into a particular category.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This dataset contains ratings obtained from an experiment where 4 raters classified 14 subjects into 5 
possible categories labeled as a, b, c, d, and e. None of the 4 raters scored all 14 units. Therefore, 
some missing ratings appear in each of the columns associated with the 4 raters.
</p>
<p>Note that only the the 4 last columns are to be used with the functions included in this package.  The first 2
columns only play a descriptive role and are not used in any calculation.
