<h2>Miscellaneous utils for Italian fiscal codes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These package provide tools to deal with fiscal codes: a function
to check if the fiscal code is valid (<code>wrong_fc</code>) and
another to guess the code given personal data (<code>guess_fc</code>).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Fiscal codes are far from perfect but ubiquitous personal id codes in
Italy, especially useful for merge purposes from a data analyst
standpoint.
</p>
<p><b>WARNING</b>: provided routines aim to be reasonably good. Unfortunately
can't be perfect since, as wikipedia puts it, "On the internet, there
are several web sites and software packages that allow one to calculate
one's tax code. However, the only official tax code is the one provided
by the tax office, which handles cases of identical tax codes (which is
a pretty frequent case for people not born in Italy, as in this case the
4-characters town code in the codice fiscale is replace by a 3-digit
country code), an arbitrary changing of a tax code, as well as cases
where a code is incorrect, but still valid (because provided by the tax
office)."
