<h3>Arguments</h3>

<td><code>IATdata</code></td>
<td>

<p>a dataframe with the following columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>subject</code>: (factor or coercible to factor). Univocally identifies a participant.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>correct</code>: (logical). has value <code>TRUE</code> or <code>1</code> if the trial was answered correctly, <code>FALSE</code> or <code>0</code> otherwise.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>latency</code>: (numeric). Response latency, in ms. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>blockcode</code>: (factor or string). Can assume only two values, <code>"pair1"</code> and <code>"pair2"</code>. <code>"pair1"</code> is for one critical block and <code>"pair2"</code> is the other critical block.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>praccrit</code>. (factor, optional). Can assume only two values, <code>"prac"</code> is for practice combined categorization block and <code>"crit"</code> is for critical combined categorization block. In a IAT with 60 trials for each double categorization block, the first 20 are sometimes administered as practice block, the other 40 as critical.

<p>(Vector of strings). Determines how the latencies are treated for computing the scores. Can include one or more of the following strings. It is worth noticing that latencies &gt; 10s are excluded by default, independent of P1.

<li> <p><code>"none"</code>: Do nothing.

<td><code>P2</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Vector of strings). Determines how the error latencies are treated. Can include one or more of the following strings.
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>"ignore"</code>: Disregard the correct-error distinction, treat all the latencies as if they were correct latencies.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"exclude"</code>: Remove error latencies and consider only the correct ones.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"recode"</code>: Recode the error latencies with the M+2SD of correct latencies. In the computation of the M and of the SD, all correct latencies are considered that are &lt; 10s.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"separate"</code>: Apply parameter P1 separately for correct and error latencies. Notice that for parameter 1 equal to "none", "fxtrim", and "fxwins", if P4 = "ignore" and P4 = "separate", the result is the same.)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"recode600"</code>: Recode the error latencies with the the mean of correct latencies + 600ms. In the computation of the Mean, all correct latencies are considered that are &lt; 10s.

<li> <p><code>"dscore"</code>. Compute the Dscores as M pair2 - Mpair1 / pooled SD.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"gscore"</code>. Compute the Gscores, as shown in Nosek, Bar-Anan, Sriram, &amp; Greenwald (2013).

<li> <p><code>minid</code>. Compute the minidifferences, i.e., the differences between any latency in pair2 and any latency in pair1. Then compute the IAT scores as the Mean of the minidifferences, divided by their SD.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>minid_t10</code>. Compute the 10% trimmed minidifferences, which are identical to the minidiffernces, but instead of the mean, the 10% trimmed mean is used.

<p>In computing the minidifferences, a very large dataframe is required. <code>maxMemory</code> specifies the maximum size of this dataframe, in MB. This limit is respected by "slicing" the dataset and computing the scores separately for many subsets of participants. This can slow the computation a bit, but prevents RAM overflows.

<p>if <code>TRUE</code> (the default), participants with less than 3 correct responses with latency between 400ms and 10s in each block are excluded from the analyses. Disabling this option can result in computing some variants of IAT scores on too few trials and it can lead to errors and missing values. Change this parameter to <code>FALSE</code> only if you know what you are doing.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A precise description of the parameters can be found in Richetin et al. (2015, Table 1).
The procedure for computing the scores is the following.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> First parameter P4 is applied: for <code>"nodist"</code> the whole dataset is given as input, for <code>"dist"</code> the dataset is first split in two parts according to column <code>praccrit</code> and then given in input.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Second, the parameter P1 and P2 are applied: correct and error latencies are treated for each combinations of P1 and P2 and a new column is internally created.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Third, parameter P3 is applied. On each and every vector of latencies defined by a combination of P1 and P2, the IAT scores are computed using all the methods specified in P3.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Finally, for P4 = <code>"dist"</code>, the scores computed i the practice and critical blocks are averaged.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Functions <code>D2</code>, <code>D5</code>, and <code>D6</code> are simple wrappers around RobustScores that allow computing the D2, D5, and D6 scores shown in Greenwald et al. (2003).
Similarly, <code>D2SWND</code>, <code>D5SWND</code>, and <code>D6SWND</code> allow computing the same D2, D5, and D6 scores with the improvements proposed by Richetin et al. (2015): use of statistical winsorizing (SW) and no distinction (ND) between practice and critical blocks.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe with as many columns as subjects, and as many rows as the possible combinations of the parameters P1, P2, P3 and P4.
</p>
<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<td>
<p>The identifier of the participant</p>

<p>.
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p1342</code></td>
<td>
<p>The IAT score variants computed. Each number after the p indicates the value of the parameter corresponding to the position. For instance <code>p1342</code> indicates that parameter P1 has value 1 (i.e. <code>"none"</code>), parameter P2 has value 3, i.e., <code>recode</code>, parameter P3 has value 4 (i.e., <code>"minid"</code>) and parameter P4 has value 2 (i.e. <code>"dist"</code>). This naming convention was adopted to allow to immediately and precisely know what has been done by reading the name of the score.</p>
