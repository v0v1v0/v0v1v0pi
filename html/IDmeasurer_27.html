<p>Male Yellow-breasted boubous were recorded in Bamenda region in Cameroon.
Birds were recorded between 06.00 to 10.00 in the morning in 2016, typically,
from the distance of 10 - 20 meters. The calls were recorded after short
provocation with playback. Repertoire of males at the field site included
three distinct call types and only the most common call typed labeled as
“High wee woo” was used for this study. The original dataset comprised 33
individuals and 10 calls per individual. <br><br>
Variables were selected to measure basic spectral parameters of each “high
weewoo” call like the peak frequency, distribution of frequency amplitudes
within spectrum, and range of the frequencies (minimum and maximum).
Additionally, the duration of the call was measured. Variables were extracted
in Raven Pro 1.5 by the Cornell Bioacoustic Research Program.

<dt>id</dt>
<dd>
<p>factor, identity code of an individual emitting the call</p>
</dd>
<dt>dur</dt>
<dd>
<p>duration of the call, in seconds</p>
</dd>
<dt>df</dt>
<dd>
<p>frequency of maximum amplitude within the spectrum - peak frequency, in Hertz</p>
</dd>
<dt>minf, maxf</dt>
<dd>
<p>minimum and maximum fequency at -25dB relative to the call peak amplitude, in Hertz</p>
</dd>
<dt>q25, q75</dt>
<dd>
