<h2>DNA Extraction Concentration Data on Coyotes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A total of 30 different coyotes were used for the study. One of the methods was the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit and the other was the more traditional chloroform isoamyl alcohol method. Selected randomly, 6 of these coyotes were measured using both methods; 8 were measured with the kit method only and the remaining 16 were measured with chloroform method only.
