<h2>Linear regression of X,Y,Z-variables with correlated errors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements the maximum likelihood algorithm of Ludwig and
Titterington (1994) for linear regression of three dimensional data
with correlated uncertainties.

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an <code>[nx9]</code> matrix with the following columns:
<code>X, sX,</code> <code>Y, sY,</code> <code>Z, sZ</code>, <code>rXY,</code>
<code>rXZ,</code> <code>rYZ</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Ludwig and Titterington (1994)'s 3-dimensional linear regression
algorithm for data with correlated uncertainties is an extension of
the 2-dimensional algorithm by Titterington and Halliday (1979),
which itself is equivalent to the algorithm of York et al. (2004).
Given <code class="reqn">n</code> triplets of (approximately) collinear measurements
<code class="reqn">X_i</code>, <code class="reqn">Y_i</code> and <code class="reqn">Z_i</code> (for <code class="reqn">1 \leq i \leq n</code>),
their uncertainties <code class="reqn">s[X_i]</code>, <code class="reqn">s[Y_i]</code> and <code class="reqn">s[Z_i]</code>,
and their covariances cov[<code class="reqn">X_i,Y_i</code>], cov[<code class="reqn">X_i,Z_i</code>] and
cov[<code class="reqn">Y_i,Z_i</code>], the <code>titterington</code> function fits two
slopes and intercepts with their uncertainties. It computes the
MSWD as a measure of under/overdispersion.  Overdispersed datasets
(MSWD&gt;1) can be dealt with in the same three ways that are
described in the documentation of the <code>isochron</code>
function.
