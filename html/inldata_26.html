<p>The INL boundary was digitized from 7.5' quads within and in the vicinity of the Idaho
National Laboratory by the U.S. Geological Survey
<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/idaho-water-science-center/science/idaho-national-laboratory-project-office">Idaho National Laboratory Project Office</a>
The digitized polygons were made into shapefiles and converted into GeoJSON files.
