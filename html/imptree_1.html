<h2>imptree: Classification Trees with Imprecise Probabilities</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>imptree</code> package implements the creation of 
imprecise classification trees based on algorithm developed by 
Abellan and Moral. 
The credal sets of the classification variable within each node
are estimated by either the imprecise Dirichlet model (IDM) or the 
nonparametric predictive inference (NPI).
As split possible split criteria serve the 'information gain', 
based on the maximal entropy distribution, and the adaptable 
entropy-range based criterion propsed by Fink and Crossman.
It also implements different correction terms for the entropy.
</p>
<p>The performance of the tree can be evaluated with respect to the
common criteria in the context of imprecise classification trees.
</p>
<p>It also provides the functionality for estimating credal sets via 
IDM or NPI and obtain their minimal/maximal entropy (distribution) 
to be used outside the tree growing process.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("carEvaluation")

## create a tree with IDM (s=1) to full size
## carEvaluation, leaving the first 10 observations out
ip &lt;- imptree(acceptance~., data = carEvaluation[-(1:10),], 
  method="IDM", method.param = list(splitmetric = "globalmax", s = 1), 
  control = list(depth = NULL, minbucket = 1))

## summarize the tree and show performance on training data
summary(ip)

## predict the first 10 observations
## Note: The result of the prediction is return invisibly
pp &lt;- predict(ip, dominance = "max", data = carEvaluation[(1:10),])
## print the general evaluation statistics
print(pp)
## display the predicted class labels
pp$classes
