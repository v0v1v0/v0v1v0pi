<h2>Pseudo-count D2 method</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function calculates the Pseudo-count <code class="reqn">D^{2}</code> statistic
to evaluate item parameter drift, as described by Cappaert et al. (2018) and Stone (2000).
The Pseudo-count <code class="reqn">D^{2}</code> statistic is designed to detect item parameter drift efficiently
without requiring item recalibration, making it especially valuable in computerized adaptive
testing (CAT) environments. This method compares observed and expected response frequencies
across quadrature points, which represent latent ability levels. The expected frequencies are
computed using the posterior distribution of each examinee's ability (Stone, 2000), providing
a robust and sensitive measure of item parameter drift, ensuring the stability and accuracy
of the test over time.
</p>

The weights and quadrature points can be easily obtained using the function <code>gen.weight</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Pseudo-count <code class="reqn">D^{2}</code> values are calculated by summing the
weighted squared differences between the observed and expected frequencies
for each score category across all items. The expected frequencies are determined
using the posterior distribution of each examinee's ability (Stone, 2000).
</p>
<p>The Pseudo-count <code class="reqn">D^{2}</code> statistic is calculated as:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
Pseudo-count D^{2} = \sum_{k=1}^{Q} \left( \frac{r_{0k} + r_{1k}}{N}\right) \left( \frac{r_{1k}}{r_{0k} + r_{1k}} - E_{1k} \right)^2
</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">r_{0k}</code> and <code class="reqn">r_{1k}</code> are the pseudo-counts for the incorrect and correct responses
at each ability level <code class="reqn">k</code>, <code class="reqn">E_{1k}</code> is the expected proportion of correct responses at each ability level <code class="reqn">k</code>,
calculated using item parameters from the item bank, and <code class="reqn">N</code> is the total count of examinees
who received each item
</p>
<p>The <code>pcd2</code> function is designed to be flexible and allows for detailed control over
the computation process through its various arguments:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>x</dt>
<dd>
<p>The metadata should include key information such as the number of score
categories for each item, the IRT model applied (e.g., "1PLM", "2PLM", "3PLM"),
and the item parameters (e.g., discrimination, difficulty, guessing). This
data frame is crucial because it defines the structure of the items and
the parameters used in the calculation of expected frequencies.</p>
</dd>
<dt>data</dt>
<dd>
<p>The response matrix should be preprocessed to ensure that missing values
are correctly coded (using the 'missing' argument if needed). The matrix is
the foundation for calculating both observed and expected frequencies for
each item and score category. Ensure that the number of items in this matrix
matches the number specified in the 'x' argument.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Quadrature</dt>
<dd>
<p>The quadrature points are used to approximate the latent ability
distribution, which is essential for accurately estimating the posterior
distribution of abilities. Adjust the number and range of quadrature points
based on the precision required and the characteristics of the examinee population.</p>
</dd>
<dt>weights</dt>
<dd>
<p>This argument allows you to provide a custom two-column matrix or data
frame where the first column contains quadrature points and the second column contains
the corresponding weights. This provides flexibility in defining the latent ability
distribution. If 'weights' is set to 'NULL', the function generates a normal prior
distribution based on the values provided in 'Quadrature', 'group.mean', and
'group.var'. Use this argument when you have a specific latent ability distribution
you wish to apply, such as one derived from empirical data or an alternative theoretical
distribution.</p>
</dd>
<dt>group.mean, group.var</dt>
<dd>
<p>These numeric values define the mean and variance
of the latent ability distribution when 'weights' is not provided. The default values
are 'group.mean = 0' and 'group.var = 1', which assume a standard normal distribution.
These values are used to generate quadrature points and weights internally if 'weights'
is 'NULL'. Adjust 'group.mean' and 'group.var' to reflect the expected distribution
of abilities in your examinee population, particularly if you suspect that the latent
trait distribution deviates from normality.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When setting these arguments, consider the specific characteristics of your item
bank, the distribution of abilities in your examinee population, and the computational
precision required. Properly configured, the function provides robust and accurate
Pseudo-count <code class="reqn">D^{2}</code> statistics, enabling effective monitoring of item parameter
drift in CAT or other IRT-based testing environments.
</p>
