Interpolation and Extrapolation for three dimensions of biodiversity
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>iNEXT.3D</code> (iNterpolation and EXTrapolation for three dimensions of biodiversity) is a sequel to <code>iNEXT</code> (Hsieh et al., 2016).
Here the three dimensions (3D) of diversity refer to taxonomic diversity (TD), phylogenetic diversity (PD) and functional diversity (FD). An online version "iNEXT.3D Online"
(https://chao.shinyapps.io/iNEXT_3D/) is also available for users without an R background.
</p>
<p>A unified framework based on Hill numbers (for TD) and their generalizations (Hill-Chao numbers, for PD and FD) 
is adopted to quantify 3D. In this framework, TD quantifies the effective number of species, PD quantifies the effective total branch length, mean-PD (PD divided by 
tree depth) quantifies the effective number of lineages, and FD quantifies the effective number of virtual functional 
groups (or functional "species"). Thus, TD, mean-PD, and FD are all in the same units of species/lineage equivalents 
and can be meaningfully compared; see Chao et al. (2014) for the basic standardization theory for TD, and Chao et al. (2021) for a review of the unified theory for 3D.
</p>
<p>For each of the three dimensions of biodiversity, <code>iNEXT.3D</code> features two statistical analyses (non-asymptotic and asymptotic):
</p>
<p>(1) A non-asymptotic approach based on interpolation and extrapolation for 3D diversity (i.e., Hill-Chao numbers)
</p>
<p><code>iNEXT.3D</code> computes the estimated 3D diversity for standardized samples with a common sample size or sample completeness. This approach aims to compare diversity estimates for equally-large (with a common sample size) or equally-complete (with a common sample coverage) samples; it is based on the seamless rarefaction and extrapolation (R/E) sampling curves of Hill-Chao numbers for q = 0, 1 and 2. For each dimension of biodiversity, <code>iNEXT.3D</code> offers three types of R/E sampling curves:
</p>
<p>* Sample-size-based (or size-based) R/E sampling curves: This type of sampling curve plots the diversity estimates with respect to sample size.
</p>
<p>* Coverage-based R/E sampling curves: This type of sampling curve plots the diversity estimates with respect to sample coverage.
</p>
<p>* Sample completeness curve: This curve depicts how sample coverage varies with sample size. The sample completeness curve provides a bridge between the size- and coverage-based R/E sampling curves.
</p>
<p>(2) An asymptotic approach to infer asymptotic 3D diversity (i.e., Hill-Chao numbers)
</p>
<p><code>iNEXT.3D</code> computes the estimated asymptotic 3D diversity and also plots 3D diversity profiles (q-profiles) for q between 0 and 2, in comparison with the observed diversity. Typically, the asymptotic estimates for q <code class="reqn">\geq</code> 1 are reliable, but for q &lt; 1 (especially for q = 0, species richness), the asymptotic estimates represent only lower bounds. <code>iNEXT.3D</code> also features a time-profile (which depicts the observed and asymptotic estimate of PD or mean PD with respect to reference times), and a tau-profile (which depicts the observed and asymptotic estimate of FD with respect to threshold level tau). <br></p>
<p>There are six main functions in this package: <br></p>
<p>1. <code>iNEXT3D</code> computes standardized 3D diversity of order q = 0, 1 and 2 for rarefied and extrapolated samples at specified sample coverage values and sample sizes. <br></p>
<p>2. <code>ggiNEXT3D</code> visualizes the output from the function <code>iNEXT3D</code>. <br></p>
<p>3. <code>ObsAsy3D</code> computes observed and asymptotic diversity of order q between 0 and 2 (in increments of 0.2) for 3D diversity; it also computes observed and asymptotic PD for specified reference times, and observed and asymptotic FD for specified threshold levels. <br></p>
<p>4. <code>ggObsAsy3D</code> visualizes the output from the function <code>ObsAsy3D</code>. <br></p>
<p>5. <code>estimate3D</code> computes 3D diversity of order q = 0, 1 and 2 with a particular set of user-specified level of sample sizes or sample coverage values. <br></p>
<p>6. <code>DataInfo3D</code> provides basic data information based on the observed data. <br></p>
