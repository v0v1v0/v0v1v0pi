<h2>A data table defining typical neutral losses in GC-APCI-MS for silylated compounds.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data table defining typical neutral losses in GC-APCI-MS for silylated compounds.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(neutral_losses_ESI)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 22 observations on the following 3 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Name</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a character vector containing the fragment name used for plot annnotation</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Formula</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a character vector containing chemical formulas</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Mass</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector containing the mass according to Formula</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data frame consists of two character columns ('Name' and 'Formula') and the numeric column 'Mass'.
In a mass spectrum peak pairs are analyzed for mass differences similar to the ones defined in neutral_losses.
If such a mass difference is observed, we can assume that the according 'Formula' is the true neutral loss
observed in this spectrum. In a plot this peak pair would be connected by a grey line and annotated with
the information from 'Name'. In formula evaluation this peak pair would be used to limit formula suggestions
with respect to plausibility, i.e. if mass fragments A and B exist with mass difference 16.0313 than we can
assume that the respective sum formulas have to be different by CH4. In consequence we can exclude sum formula
suggestions for B which do not have a valid corresponding sum formula in A and vice versa.
