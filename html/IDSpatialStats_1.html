<h2>Simulated dataset of dengue transmission with basic reproductive number of 1</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Dataset simulated using an agent based model with a spatially heterogeneous population structure. Infectious agents
were introduced resulting in agent to agent transmission. The distance between successive cases in a transmission chain
were randomly drawn from a uniform distribution U(0,100). Each infectious agent resulted in a single transmission to
another agent after a delay of 15 days, reflecting the generation time of dengue. There are 11 transmission chains,
each with a different genotype. The genotypes are subdivided into four serotypes.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">DengueSimR01

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Matrix with five columns representing the X and Y coordinates of infected individuals, the time of infection,
the genotype of the infecting pathogen and the serotype of the infecting pathogen.
