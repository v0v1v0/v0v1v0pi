<h2>AIDS Cohort Study on Patients with Hemophilia</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The study population for this example consists of 257 individuals with Type A or B hemophilia
who had been treated at two French hospitals since 1978. These
patients were at risk for infection by the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) through contaminated blood factor received for their
treatment. By the time of analysis, 188 patients were found to be
infected with the virus, 41 of whom subsequently progressed to the
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or other related clinical
symptoms. For reasons of simplicity, we refer to all of these events
as AIDS. The primary goal of the analysis was to assess the effects of
level of treatment received for hemophilia, and age, on the risk of
developing AIDS-related symptoms.
</p>
<p>The time scale was obtained by dividing the real time axis into 6-month
intervals, with <code class="reqn">T=1</code> denoting the time period from January 1,
1978 to June 30, 1978.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(aidsCohort)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>a data frame with 257 rows and the following variables
</p>

<dl>
<dt>L.Y</dt>
<dd>
<p>left (lower) limit of interval containing the infection time.</p>
</dd>
<dt>R.Y</dt>
<dd>
<p>right (upper) limit of interval containing the infection
time. It is equal to <code>NA</code> for those with right-censored
infection time at <code>L.Y</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>L.Z</dt>
<dd>
<p>left (lower) limit of interval containing the time of the
first clinical symptoms. It is equal to <code>NA</code> for those who
were not infected by the end of the study period.</p>
</dd>
<dt>R.Z</dt>
<dd>
<p>right (upper) limit of interval containing the time of the
first clinical symptoms. It is equal to <code>NA</code> for those who
were not infected by the end of the study period or for those
whose time of the first clinical symptoms is right-censored at
<code>L.Z</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>age</dt>
<dd>
<p>the age covariate which is equal to 1 if the estimated
age at time infection is <code class="reqn">&lt;20</code> years, and 2 otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt>group</dt>
<dd>
<p>treatment group. It is 0 for lightly treated group and
1 for heavily treated group.</p>
</dd>
<dt>fage</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>factor</code> variable created from <code>age</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>fgroup</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>factor</code> variable created from <code>group</code>.</p>
</dd>        
</dl>
