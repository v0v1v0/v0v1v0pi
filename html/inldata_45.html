<h2>Site Information</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Information for sites in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) monitoring networks,
Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and vicinity, Idaho.
The monitoring networks at the INL have evolved to their current 2024 schedules
of monitoring because groundwater and surface-water sites were installed for various reasons;
for example, the need to estimate the volume of the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer,
or to document and understand changes in water quality.
The USGS compiled the list of sites monitored by the USGS using publications by
Knobel and others (2005, table 1) and Bartholomay (2022, table 1).
One well site
(site no. <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory/?site_no=425812113271201">425812113271201</a>)
was omitted from the dataset because its geographical location falls outside the designated study area.

<h3>Source</h3>

<p>USGS site data acquired from the NWIS (U.S. Geological Survey, 2023).
The station name (<code>station_nm</code>) for the data was parsed for a more readable name.
A borehole completion code (<code>completion_cd</code>),
as well as an aquifer monitoring network code (<code>network_cd</code>) were created.
A position specifier for site-labels on a map (<code>pos</code>) was also created.
The classes of the columns were specified, and any unnecessary columns were removed.
