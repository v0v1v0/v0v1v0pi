The codes and their meanings are as follows:
"ArtificialPath" is a surrogate for general flow direction;
"CanalDitch" is an artificial open waterway constructed to transport water,
to irrigate or drain land, to connect two or more bodies of water,
or to serve as a waterway for watercraft;
"Connector"is a linear water feature that connects two or more waterbodies or
other linear water features; and
"StreamRiver" is a linear water feature that is a natural or man-made flowing body of water.</p>
