<h2>ICD-10-CM</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The public domain modified ICD-10 classification as published in the public
domain by the US CDC. Currently this has a slightly different structure to
<code>icd9cm_hierarchy</code> because the published data helpfully has a
<em>leaf</em> flag indicating whether a code is a <em>billable</em> leaf node, or
a code higher in the hierarchy which nevertheless will have a description.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are annual revisions to this data. Currently, the 2016 edition is
included.
</p>
<p>Format:  data frame, with columns for code, leaf status (0 or 1), short and
long descriptions.
