<h2>Age at walking</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>zelazo</code> object is a list with four components.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">zelazo</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This is a list containing data on age at
walking (in months) for four groups of infants: 
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>active</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>test group receiving active training; these children had
their walking and placing reflexes
trained during four three-minute sessions that took place every day
from their second to their eighth week of life.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>passive</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>passive training group; these children received the same types of
social and gross motor stimulation, 
but did not have their specific walking and placing reflexes
trained. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>none</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>no training; these children  had no special training, but
were tested along with the children who underwent active or passive
training.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ctr.8w</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>eighth-week controls; these children had no training and were only
tested at the age of 8 weeks. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>When asked to enter these data from a text source, many
students will use one vector per group and will need to reformat data
into a data frame for some uses. The rather unusual format of this data set
mimics that situation.
