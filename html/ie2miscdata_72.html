<h2>Global Engineering Weather Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>"The data in this table were compiled by the Air Force Combat
Climatology Center (AFCCC) at the request of the Air Force Civil Engineer
Support Agency (HQ AFCESA). Sites were identified by AFCESA, US Army Corps
of Engineers (USACE), and the Naval Facilities Engineering Command
(NAVFACENGCOM). Final site selection was based upon availability of
climatological data. Most sites are located at military installations
supporting airfield operations or at local airports/airfields."
