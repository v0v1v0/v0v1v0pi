<h2>Toy Example for ODS Design with Interval-Censored Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set gives a simple toy example of ODS design with interval-censored data.
It was generated following the simulation study used to illustrate the method
in the original manuscript referenced below. 
This dataset is not meaningful and is intended for demonstration purposes only.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(odsData)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data.frame containing 501 observations with 6 columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>U</dt>
<dd>
<p>examination time; see Details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>V</dt>
<dd>
<p>examination time; see Details.</p>
</dd>
<dt>del1</dt>
<dd>
<p>indicator of a left-censored observation I(T&lt;=U).</p>
</dd> 
<dt>del2</dt>
<dd>
<p>indicator of an interval-censored observation I(U&lt;T&lt;=V).</p>
</dd>
<dt>z</dt>
<dd>
<p>covariates.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ind</dt>
<dd>
<p>indicating membership of the simple random sample (0), lower-tail 
supplemental sample (1), or upper-tail supplemental sample (2).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data can be understood as follow.
There are 
K follow-up examinations at times TE = (T1, T2, ..., TK), and the failure
time is denoted as TF. 
For left-censored data, the failure occurred prior to the first 
follow-up examination (TF &lt; T1); therefore, U = T1, V = tau, and 
(del1,del2)=(1,0). For right-censored data, the
failure had not yet occurred at the last follow-up examination 
(TF &gt; TK); therefore, U = 0, V = TK, 
and (del1,del2)=(0,0). For interval-censored data, the failure occurred
between two follow-up examinations, e.g. T2 &lt; TF &lt; T3; therefore, 
U and V to be the two consecutive follow-up examination times 
bracketing the failure time TF and (del1,del2)=(0,1).
