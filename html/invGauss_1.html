<h2>Carcinoma of the oropharynx</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An example from clinical medicine given by Kalbfleisch and Prentice (2002), a clinical trial on 195 patients with carcinoma of the oropharynx carried out by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group in the United States. The patients were randomized into two treatment groups (“standard” and “test” treatment), and survival times were measured in days (rather, years in this recoded data set) from diagnosis.

</dd>
<dt>T-stage</dt>
<dd>
<p>(an index of size and infiltration of tumor ranging from 1 to 4, with 1 indicating a small tumor and 4 a massive invasive tumor)</p>
