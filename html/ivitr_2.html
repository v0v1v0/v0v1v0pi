<h2>Estimate the Balke-Pearl bound for each instance in a dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>estimate_BP_bound</code> estimates the Balke-Pearl bound for
each instance in the input dataset with a binary IV, observed
covariates, a binary treatment indicator, and a binary outcome.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">estimate_BP_bound(dt, method = "rf", nodesize = 5)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dt</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dataframe whose first column is a binary IV 'Z', followed
by q columns of observed covariates, followed by a binary
treatment indicator 'A', and finally followed by a binary
outcome 'Y'. The dataset has q+3 columns in total.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string indicator the method used to estimate
each constituent conditional probability of the
Balke-Pearl bound. Users can choose to fit multinomial
regression by setting method = 'multinom', and random
forest by setting method = 'rf'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nodesize</code></td>
<td>
<p>Node size to be used in a random forest algorithm if
method is set to 'rf'. The default value is set to 5.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The original dataframe with two additional columns: L and U.
L indicates the Balke-Pearl lower bound and U is the Balke-Pearl
upper bound.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">attach(dt_Rouse)
# Construct an IV out of differential distance to two-year versus
# four-year college. Z = 1 if the subject lives not farther from
# a 4-year college compared to a 2-year college.
Z = (dist4yr &lt;= dist2yr) + 0

# Treatment A = 1 if the subject attends a 4-year college and 0
# otherwise.
A = 1 - twoyr

# Outcome Y = 1 if the subject obtained a bachelor's degree
Y = (educ86 &gt;= 16) + 0

# Prepare the dataset
dt = data.frame(Z, female, black, hispanic, bytest, dadsome,
     dadcoll, momsome, momcoll, fincome, fincmiss, A, Y)

# Calculate the Balke-Pearl bound by estimating each constituent
# conditional probability p(Y = y, A = a | Z, X) with a random
# forest.
dt_with_BP_bound_rf = estimate_BP_bound(dt, method = 'rf', nodesize = 5)

# Calculate the Balke-Pearl bound by estimating each constituent
# conditional probability p(Y = y, A = a | Z, X) with a multinomial
# regression.
dt_with_BP_bound_multinom = estimate_BP_bound(dt, method = 'multinom')
