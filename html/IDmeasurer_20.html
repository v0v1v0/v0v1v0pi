<p>Corncrake calls were recorded at three sites in Poland and one in the Czech
Republic Recordings were made during the corncrake breeding season, from 8 to
30 July, in 2011 and in 2012. Males were recorded when calling spontaneously,
in favourable conditions, at night (from 22.00 to 03.30, local time) from a
distance of ca. 5-10 m. The original dataset comprised 104 males with 10
calls measured from each male.<br><br>
Formants (second to fifth) were measured within the first syllable of the
call. Formants were extracted by PRAAT.
