<h2>Find the largest common connected subgraph (LCCS) of two graphs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Find the largest common connected subgraphs of
two matched graphs, which is an induced connected subgraph of both graphs
that has as many vertices as possible.
The <code>largest_cc</code> function returns the largest connected subgraph of a single graph.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">largest_common_cc(A, B, min_degree = 1)

largest_cc(A)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>A</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix or an igraph object. See check_graph. Must be single-layer.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>B</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix or an igraph object. See check_graph. Must be single-layer.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min_degree</code></td>
<td>
<p>A number. Defines the level of connectedness of the
obtained largest common connected subgraph. The induced subgraph is
a graph with a minimum vertex-degree of at least min_degree.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>largest_common_cc</code> returns the common largest connected subgraphs of
two aligned graphs in the igraph object form and a logical vector indicating which vertices in
the original graphs remain in the induced subgraph.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cgnp_pair &lt;- sample_correlated_gnp_pair(n = 10, corr =  0.7, p =  0.2)
g1 &lt;- cgnp_pair$graph1
g2 &lt;- cgnp_pair$graph2
# put no constraint on the minimum degree of the common largest conncect subgraph
lccs1 &lt;- largest_common_cc(g1, g2, min_degree = 1)
# induced subgraph
lccs1$g1
lccs1$g2
# label of vertices of the induced subgraph in the original graph
igraph::V(g1)[lccs1$keep]

# obtain a common largest connect subgraph with each vertex having a minimum degree of 3
lccs3 &lt;- largest_common_cc(g1, g2, min_degree = 3)

g &lt;- igraph::sample_gnp(100, .01)
lcc &lt;- largest_cc(g)
# induced subgraph
lcc$g
# label of vertices of the induced subgraph in the original graph
igraph::V(g)[lcc$keep]
