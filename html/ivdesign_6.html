<h2>Two-sided test for the pooled effect ratio estimand</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>PER</code> returns the two-sided p-value testing
the pooled effect ratio equal to lambda_0 in a cluster-randomized
encouragement experiment.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Q is used to construct a regression-assisted variance estimator.
Q is can in principle be any K times p design matrix such that p &lt; K.
When Q is a column vector of 1's, the variance estimator is the classical
sample variance estimator. More generally, Q may contain any cluster-level
or even unit-level covariate information that are predictive of the
encouraged-minus-control difference in the observed aggregated outcomes.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of five elements: two-sided p-value, deviate, test statistics,
expectation of the test statistic under the null hypothesis,
and variance of the test statistic under the null hypothesis.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">R_t = encouraged_clusters$aggregated_outcome
R_c = control_clusters$aggregated_outcome
d_t = encouraged_clusters$aggregated_treatment
d_c = control_clusters$aggregated_treatment


# Test the pooled effect ratio estimand lambda = 0 using
# the default sample variance estimator, i.e., setting Q = NULL.
res = PER(0, R_t, R_c, d_t, d_c)

# We may leverage observed covariates from both the encouraged
# and control clusters to construct less conservative variance
# estimator. The variance estimator will be less conservative if
# these covariate predict the treated-minus-control difference
# in the outcome. In this illustrated dataset, V1-V10 are simulated
# white noise; it is not surprising that they do not help
# reduce the variance.
Q = cbind(encouraged_clusters[,1:10], control_clusters[,1:10])
res_2 = PER(0, R_t, R_c, d_t, d_c, Q)
