<h2>Mean of Squares for Raters (MSR) under ANOVA Model 1B.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This MSR is associated with the one-factor ANOVA model where each rater may rate a different group of subjects. This MSR is used
for calculating confidence intervals and p-values associated with the intra-rater reliability coefficient.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">msr1b.fn(dfra)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dfra</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is a data frame containing 3 columns or more.  The first column contains subject numbers (there could be duplicates
if a subject was assigned multiple ratings) and each of the remaining columns is associated with a particular rater and contains its
numeric ratings.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns a vector containing 2 values:
1. msr: the MSR. 2. r: The number of raters that participated in the experiment.
