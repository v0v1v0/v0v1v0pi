<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Growth vigour of stands of spruce trees in New Brunswick, Canada.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("vigour")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 23 observations (rows).  The first column
is the year of observation (1965 to 1987 inclusive).  The other
five columns are observations on the vigour of growth of the
given stand in each of the years.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The stands each had different initial tree densities.  It was
expected that vigour would initially increase (as the trees
increased in size) and then level off and start to decrease as the
growing trees encroached upon each others' space and competed more
strongly for resources such as moisture, nutrients, and light.
It was further expected that the position of the mode of the
vigour observations would depend upon the initial densities.
</p>

<p>These data were collected and generously made available by Kirk
Schmidt who was at the time of collecting the data a graduate
student in the Department of Forest Engineering at the University
of New Brunswick, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada.  The data
were collected as part of his research for his Master's degree
(supervised by Professor Ted Needham) at the University of New
Brunswick.  See Schmidt (1993).
