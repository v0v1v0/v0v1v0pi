<p>Calls of little owls were collected in Czech Republic and Hungary.
Territorial calls of each male were recorded for three minutes after a short
playback provocation (1 min) inside their territories from up to 50 m
distance from the individuals. The recordings were made during comparable,
favourable meteorological conditions (without strong wind or precipitation),
from sunset until midnight between March and April of 2013 and 2014. This period
covered the mating season. The period and the time of the day for recording
were selected with regard to the peak in vocal activity of little owls both
within a day and within a season. The original dataset included 54 males with
more than 20 calls each (20-41 calls per individual, mean, SD = 26.9, 6.0)
with good recording quality.The number of individuals and calls per
individual was reduced to match parameters of the other datasets.<br><br>
Variables were selected to measure basic parameters of call spectrum
like the peak frequency, distribution of frequency amplitudes within
spectrum, and range of the frequencies (minimum and maximum). Additionally,
the duration of the call was measured. Variables were extracted in SASLab Pro
by Avisoft.
