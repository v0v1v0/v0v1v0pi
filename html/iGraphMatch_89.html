<h2>Graph Matching Methods</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>gm</code> is used to match a pair of given graphs, with
specifications of the adjacency matrices of for a pair of graphs, possible
prior knowledge, and a graph matching method.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gm(A, B, seeds = NULL, similarity = NULL, method = "indefinite", ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>A</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix, igraph object, or list of either.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>B</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix, igraph object, or list of either.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seeds</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of integers or logicals, a matrix or a data frame. If
the seed pairs have the same indices in both graphs then seeds can be a
vector. If not, seeds must be a matrix or a data frame, with the first
column being the indices of <code class="reqn">G_1</code> and the second column being the
corresponding indices of <code class="reqn">G_2</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>similarity</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix. An <code>n-by-n</code> matrix containing vertex
similarities. Mandatory for the "IsoRank" method.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Choice for graph matching methods. One of "indefinite",
"convex", "PATH", "percolation", "IsoRank", "Umeyama", or a user-defined
graph matching function. Please check Details and Examples sections for
instructions on how to define your own function.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If <code>method</code> is a function, it should take two matrices or
igraph objects, seeds and similarity scores as arguments for minimum.
Additionally, it can also take other arguments if needed. The self-defined
function should return a graphMatch class object with matching
correspondence, sizes of two input graphs, matching formula, and other
algorithm hyperparameter details.
</p>
<p>The <code>method</code> argument can also take one of the implemented algorithms,
including "indefinite",
"convex", "PATH",
"percolation", "IsoRank",
and "Umeyama".
In this case, one can pass additional arguments to the <code>gm</code> function
according to the specified method.
For a detailed list of additional arguments for each one of the implemented method,
please click on the corresponding method name for its help page.
</p>
<p>Most graph matching functions include as list elements additional details
about the match. Call <code>names()</code> on a <code>graphMatch</code> object to see
the available details. As an example, PATH, IsoRank, Umeyama, Indefinite,
and Convex each include <code>soft</code>, which is the matrix found by the
algorithm prior to projection onto the set of permutation matrices.
Similarly, PATH, Indefinite, and Convex return <code>iter</code>, the number of
iterations, and IsoRank (with greedy LAP) and Percolation return
<code>match_order</code>, the order that the node-pairs were added to the match.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>gm</code> returns an object of class "<code>graphMatch</code>".
See graphMatch-class and links therein for details
on the <code>graphMatch</code> class.
</p>
<p>Please also refer to the help page for each implemented method, i.e.
"indefinite",
"convex",
"PATH",
"percolation",
"IsoRank",
and "Umeyama"
for details on the corresponding returned list.
