<h2>Fertility of lucerne</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Ten plants were used in an experiment of fertility of lucerne Two
clusters of flowers were selected from each plant and pollinated.  One
cluster was bent down, whereas the other was exposed to wind and sun.
At the end of the experiment, the average number of seeds per pod was
counted for each cluster and the weight of 1000 seeds was registered
for each cluster.
