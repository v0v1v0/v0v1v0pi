Data for black bears in Louisiana, USA, 2007-2012
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data on the Louisiana black bear (<em>Ursus americanus luteolus</em>) were collected during six years (2007-2012) in the Upper Atchafalaya River Basin in South-central Louisiana, USA, using hair snares. Hair samples were collected during eight consecutive weeks in each year and a selection of samples were genotyped resulting in spatial capture-recapture (SCR) data. This data set includes SCR data for 2007, 2009 and 2011, plus simple occupancy data for 2008, 2010 and 2012. See Chandler and Clark (2014) for details.
</p>
<p>Note that not all hair samples were successfully genotyped, and traps were not deployed at all 128 locations in every year, leading to NAs in the data.
