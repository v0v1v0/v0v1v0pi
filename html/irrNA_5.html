<h2>Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) – generalized for randomly incomplete datasets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function computes intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) as indices of 
interrater reliability or agreement based on cardinally scaled data. This function also works on 
(unbalanced) incomplete datasets without any imputation of missing values (<em>NA</em>s) or (row- or 
cloumn-wise) omissions of data! p-values and confidence intervals are provided. In case of 
extreme input data (e.g. zero variances) output <em>NaN</em>s are avoided by approximation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">iccNA(ratings, rho0 = 0, conf = 0.95, detail = FALSE, oneG = TRUE, Cs = 10000)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is able to compute ICCs on randomly incomplete (i.e. unbalanced) data sets. 
Thus, both an imputation of missing values (<em>NA</em>s) and row-wise or column-wise omissions of 
data are obsolete. Working on complete datasets, it yields the same results as the common 
functions, e.g. icc_corr.<br>
The method of Ebel (1951) is used to calculate the oneway ICCs. The solution for the twoway 
ICCs is derived from the oneway solution (cp. Brueckl, 2011, p. 96 ff.): The raters' individual 
effects (biases) are estimated, reducing this problem again to the oneway problem (cp. Greer &amp; 
Dunlap, 1997).<br>
This estimation can be done using the difference of a certain (<code class="reqn">j</code>) rater's mean to the 
grand mean (<code class="reqn">G</code>) or to the sub-mean (<code class="reqn">G_j</code>) representing only those objects 
that were rated by this rater. The first method is fail-safe. The second method is thought to 
provide the more precise estimates (of the raters' biases), the more the mean of the true values 
of the objects that each rater rated differ from the grand mean, e.g. if there are raters that 
only rate objects with low true values (and therefore also other raters that only rate objects 
with high true values).<br>
If the second method is chosen and if the ratings are unbalanced, which happens most of the time 
if not all raters rated all objects, the raters' biases cannot be determined exactly – but as 
approximately as desired. This approximation needs an iteration, thus a stop criterion 
(<code>Cs</code>): 
The iteration is stopped, when the difference in the raters' effect size (<code class="reqn">\eta</code>-squared) 
between subsequent iterations would be equal to or smaller than the <code>Cs</code>th part of a small 
effect (i.e. <code class="reqn">\eta</code>-squared = 1%).<br><br>
Just as in icc_corr and icc, the designation established by McGraw 
&amp; Wong (1996) – <em>A</em> for <em>absolute agreement</em> and <em>C</em> for <em>consistency</em> 
– is used to differ between the (twoway) ICCs that rely on different cases and thus must be 
interpreted differently.<br><br>
The generalization of the procedure entails a generalization of the three cases that 
differentiate the ICCs (cp. Shrout &amp; Fleiss, 1979):<br>
- Case 1 (oneway case, treated by ICC(1) and ICC(k)): <br>
Each object – of a sample that was randomly drawn from the population of objects; also 
holds true for case 2 and case 3 – is rated by (a different number of) different raters 
that were randomly drawn from the population of raters.<br>
- Case 2 (twoway case, treated by ICC(A,1) and ICC(A,k)): <br>
Each object is rated by a random subset of the group of raters that is drawn randomly from 
the population of raters.<br>
- Case 3 (twoway case, treated by ICC(C,1) and ICC(C,k)): <br>
Each object is rated by a random subset of the group of all relevant (i.e. fixed) raters.<br><br>
Output NaNs, that usually occur (see e.g. icc or icc_corr) in case 
of extreme input data (e.g. in case of zero variance(s), within or between objects) are 
avoided by approximation from little less extreme input data. Warning messages are given in 
these cases.<br><br></p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Example 1:
data(ConsistNA)
# ConsistNA exhibits missing values, a perfect consistency, and 
# a moderate agreement between raters:
ConsistNA
# Common ICC-algorithms fail, since each row as well as each 
# column of ConsistNA exhibits unfilled cells and these missing 
# data are omitted column-wise or row-wise (please install and  
# load the irr package):
#icc(ConsistNA, r0=0.3)
# Ebel's (1951) method for computing ICC(1) and ICC(k) that is 
# implemented in iccNA can cope with such data without an 
# omission or an imputation of missing values, but still can 
# not depict the raters' interdependency...
iccNA(ConsistNA, rho0=0.3)
# ...but generalizations of Ebel's method for the twoway ICCs 
# are able to assess moderate agreement (ICC(A,1) and ICC(A,k)) 
# and perfect consistency (ICC(C,1) and ICC(C,k)), assuming that 
# the data were acquired under case 2 or case 3, see Details in 
# the Help file.
#
# Example 2:
data(IndepNA)
# IndepNA exhibits missing values and zero variance between 
# the raters just as well as between the objects:
IndepNA
# Again, common ICC-algorithms fail (cp. irr package):
#icc(IndepNA)
# But iccNA is able to include all available data in its 
# calculation and thereby to show the perfect independence of 
# the ratings:
iccNA(IndepNA)
#
# Example 3:
# The example provided by Ebel (1951, Tables 2 and 3):
# data(Ebel51)
Ebel51
# iCCNA achieves to include all available ratings and to assess 
# twoway ICCs, assuming that the data were acquired under 
# case 2 or case 3:
iccNA(Ebel51, detail=TRUE)
