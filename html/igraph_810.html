<h2>Finding communities in graphs based on statistical meachanics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated"><img src="../help/figures/lifecycle-deprecated.svg" alt="[Deprecated]"></a>
</p>
<p><code>spinglass.community()</code> was renamed to <code>cluster_spinglass()</code> to create a more
consistent API.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">spinglass.community(
  graph,
  weights = NULL,
  vertex = NULL,
  spins = 25,
  parupdate = FALSE,
  start.temp = 1,
  stop.temp = 0.01,
  cool.fact = 0.99,
  update.rule = c("config", "random", "simple"),
  gamma = 1,
  implementation = c("orig", "neg"),
  gamma.minus = 1
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>The input graph, can be directed but the direction of the edges
is neglected.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>The weights of the edges. It must be a positive numeric vector,
<code>NULL</code> or <code>NA</code>. If it is <code>NULL</code> and the input graph has a
‘weight’ edge attribute, then that attribute will be used. If
<code>NULL</code> and no such attribute is present, then the edges will have equal
weights. Set this to <code>NA</code> if the graph was a ‘weight’ edge
attribute, but you don't want to use it for community detection. A larger
edge weight means a stronger connection for this function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vertex</code></td>
<td>
<p>This parameter can be used to calculate the community of a
given vertex without calculating all communities. Note that if this argument
is present then some other arguments are ignored.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>spins</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer constant, the number of spins to use. This is the upper
limit for the number of communities. It is not a problem to supply a
(reasonably) big number here, in which case some spin states will be
unpopulated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parupdate</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical constant, whether to update the spins of the
vertices in parallel (synchronously) or not. This argument is ignored if the
second form of the function is used (i.e. the ‘<code>vertex</code>’ argument
is present). It is also not implemented in the “neg” implementation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>start.temp</code></td>
<td>
<p>Real constant, the start temperature.  This argument is
ignored if the second form of the function is used (i.e. the
‘<code>vertex</code>’ argument is present).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stop.temp</code></td>
<td>
<p>Real constant, the stop temperature. The simulation
terminates if the temperature lowers below this level.  This argument is
ignored if the second form of the function is used (i.e. the
‘<code>vertex</code>’ argument is present).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cool.fact</code></td>
<td>
<p>Cooling factor for the simulated annealing.  This argument
is ignored if the second form of the function is used (i.e. the
‘<code>vertex</code>’ argument is present).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>update.rule</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character constant giving the ‘null-model’ of the
simulation. Possible values: “simple” and “config”.
“simple” uses a random graph with the same number of edges as the
baseline probability and “config” uses a random graph with the same
vertex degrees as the input graph.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma</code></td>
<td>
<p>Real constant, the gamma argument of the algorithm. This
specifies the balance between the importance of present and non-present
edges in a community. Roughly, a comunity is a set of vertices having many
edges inside the community and few edges outside the community. The default
1.0 value makes existing and non-existing links equally important. Smaller
values make the existing links, greater values the missing links more
important.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>implementation</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character scalar. Currently igraph contains two
implementations for the Spin-glass community finding algorithm. The faster
original implementation is the default. The other implementation, that takes
into account negative weights, can be chosen by supplying ‘neg’ here.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma.minus</code></td>
<td>
<p>Real constant, the gamma.minus parameter of the
algorithm. This specifies the balance between the importance of present and
non-present negative weighted edges in a community. Smaller values of
gamma.minus, leads to communities with lesser negative intra-connectivity.
If this argument is set to zero, the algorithm reduces to a graph coloring
algorithm, using the number of spins as the number of colors. This argument
is ignored if the ‘orig’ implementation is chosen.</p>
