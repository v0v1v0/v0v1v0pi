<h2>Writing center data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sample data from a community college used to illustrate program evaluation methods.  The data set contains students' first enrollment/attempt in ENG 1, a first year college level writing course, over several years.  Students may choose to receive additional support outside of the classroom at the college's writing center by enrolling in a 0.5-unit writing center/conference support course.  Students may use the writing center as a study center where they have access to computers, dictionaries, thesauri, etc.  At the center, students may also schedule 1:1 conferences with the instructor on duty, to get assistance and/or feedback on their writing by bringing a writing prompt or draft of their paper.  Students registered for this support course are required to spend at least 12 hours in the center, and to have at least 2 formal conferences.
