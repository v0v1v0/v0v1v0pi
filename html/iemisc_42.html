<h2>Calculate the Station Distance between Engineering Survey Points</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes engineering survey points in various units (foot, US survey foot,
meters, or kilometers) and determines the upstream station location.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">engr_survey4(
  object,
  ds_station,
  station_distance = 100,
  units = c("foot", "survey_ft", "survey_mile", "mile", "meters", "kilometers")
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector that contains the upstream length</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ds_station</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector that contains the ending engineering
survey station value</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>station_distance</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector that contains the horizontal distance
between any 2 points along the survey, the default is 100 feet</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>units</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector that contains the system of units for the
<code>station_distance</code> (options are <code>foot</code>, <code>survey_ft</code>
(United States Customary System) [US survey foot], <code>meters</code> for
International System of Units meters, or <code>kilometers</code> for International System
of Units kilometers)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the final engineering survey position (ex. Sta. 5+55)
</p>

# Example 1

# "Conversely, if you were asked at what station a manhole 555 ft upstream of
# Sta 0+00 is, your answer would be 0.00 sta + 555 ft / 100 ft/sta = 5.55 sta =
# Sta 5+55." Source: Reference 2
