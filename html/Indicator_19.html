<h2>Function to evaluate nan imputation method's performance</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function evaluates the performance of various missing value imputation
methods in a quantitative dataframe. It is designed to examine and compare
five different imputation methods using standard performance measures
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">performance_nan_imputation(data, to_impute, regressors, method = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dataframe containing the observations (rows) and quantitative
variables (columns) to be analyzed. This dataframe includes variables with
missing values to be imputed</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>to_impute</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string specifying the name of the variable in the
dataframe that contains the missing values to be imputed</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>regressors</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of strings indicating the names of the variables
to be used as regressors for imputation in the case of methods 1
(lm_imputation) and 4 (hot deck imputation)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer between 1 and 5 that specifies the imputation
method to be used. The supported methods are:
</p>
<p>1: lm_imputation (Imputation by linear model)
</p>
<p>2: median imputation (imputation by median)
</p>
<p>3: mean imputation (imputation by mean)
</p>
<p>4: hot deck imputation (imputation via hot deck)
</p>
<p>5: EM imputation (imputation via Expectation-Maximization)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is useful for comparing the effectiveness of different methods
of imputing missing values, allowing the most appropriate method to be
chosen based on measured performance
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a dataframe that contains a row for each
imputation method and columns with performance measures. The performance
measures included are:
</p>
<p>R^2: Coefficient of Determination, which measures how well the imputed values
fit the observed values
</p>
<p>RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error, which provides a measure of the mean square
deviation between imputed and observed values
</p>
<p>MAE: Mean Absolute Error, which represents the mean absolute deviation
between the imputed and observed values
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
data("airquality")
regressors&lt;-colnames(airquality[,c(3,4)])

#---Methods 1 = Imputation by linear model
performance_nan_imputation(data =airquality,"Ozone",regressors = regressors,method = 1)

#---Methods 2 = Imputation by Median
suppressWarnings(performance_nan_imputation(data =airquality,"Ozone",method = 2))

#---Methods 3 = Imputation by Mean
suppressWarnings(performance_nan_imputation(data =airquality,"Ozone",method = 3))

#---Methods 4 = Hot Deck imputation
performance_nan_imputation(data =airquality,"Ozone",regressors = regressors,method = 4)

#---Methods 5 = Expectation-Maximization imputation
performance_nan_imputation(data =airquality,"Ozone",regressors = regressors,method = 5)
