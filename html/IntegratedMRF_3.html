<h2>Weights for combination of predictions from different data subtypes using Least Square Regression based on various error estimation techniques</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates combination weights for different subtypes of dataset combinations to generate integrated Random Forest (RF) or Multivariate Random Forest (MRF) model based on different error estimation models such as Bootstrap, 0.632+ Bootstrap, N-fold cross validation or Leave one out.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>finalX</code></td>

<p>List of Matrices where each matrix represent a specific data subtype (such as genomic characterizations for
drug sensitivity prediction). Each subtype can have different types of features. For example, if there are three subtypes containing
100, 200 and 250 features respectively,  finalX will be a list containing 3 matrices of sizes M x 100, M x 200 and M x 250

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function takes all the subtypes of dataset in matrix format and its corresponding sample information.
For calculation purpose, we have considered the data of the samples that are common in all the subtypes and output training responses.
For example, consider a dataset of 3 sub-types with different number of samples and features, with indices of samples in subtype 1, 2, 3  and output feature matrix
is 1:10, 3:15, 5:16 and 5:11 respectively. Thus, features of sample index 5:10 (common to all subtypes and output feature matrix) of all subtypes and output feature
matrix will be selected and considered for all calculations.
</p>
<p>For M x N dataset, N number of bootstrap sampling sets are considered. For each bootstrap sampling set and each subtype, a Random Forest (RF)
or, Multivariate Random Forest (MRF) model is generated, which is used for calculating the prediction performance for out-of-bag samples.
The prediction performance for each subtype of the dataset is based on the averaging over different bootstrap training sets.
The combination weights (regression coefficients) for each combination of subtypes are generated using least Square Regression from the
individual subtype predictions and used later to calculate mean absolute error, mean square error and correlation coefficient between
predicted and actual values.
</p>
<p>For N-fold cross validation error estimation with M cell lines, N models are generated for each subtype of dataset, where for each partition (M/N)*(N-1) cell
lines are used for training and the remaining cell lines are used to
estimate errors and combination weights for different data subtype combinations.
</p>
<p>In 0.632 Bootstrap error estimation, bootstrap and re-substitution error estimates are combined based on
0.632xBootstrap Error + 0.368xRe-substitution Error. While 0.632+ Bootstrap error estimation considers the overfitting of re-substitution error
with no information error rate <code class="reqn">\gamma</code>. An estimate of <code class="reqn">\gamma</code> is obtained by permuting the responses <code class="reqn">y[i]</code> and predictors <code class="reqn">x[j]</code>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\gamma=sum(sum(error(x[j],y[i]),j=1,m),i=1,m)/m^2</code>
</p>

<p>The relative overfitting rate is defined as <code class="reqn">R=(Bootstrap Error-Resubstitution Error)/(\gamma-Resubstitution Error)</code> and weight distribution
between bootstrap error and Re-substitution Error is defined as <code class="reqn">w=0.632/(1-0.368*R)</code>. So, 0.632+ Bootstrap error is equal to
<code class="reqn">(1-w)*Bootstrap Error+w*Resubstitution Error</code>.
These prediction results are then used to compute the errors and combination weights for different data subtype combinations.
</p>
<p>Confidence Interval has been calculated using Jackkniffe-After-Bootstrap Approach and prediction result of bootstrap error estimation.
</p>
<p>For leave-one-out error estimation using M cell lines, M models are generated for each subtype of dataset, which are then used to
calculate the errors and combination weights for different data subtype combinations.
