<h2>Ashina's crossover trial</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

 
<p>The <code>ashina</code> data frame has 16 rows and 3 columns. It contains
data from a crossover trial for the effect of an NO synthase inhibitor
on headaches. Visual analog scale recordings of pain levels were made
at baseline and at five time points after infusion of the drug or
placebo. A score was calculated as the sum of the differences from
baseline. Data were recorded during two sessions for each patient. Six
patients were given treatment on the first occasion and the placebo on
the second. Ten patients had placebo first and then treatment. The
order of treatment and the placebo was randomized.
