<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Parse NOAA ISD Files
</p>


<h3>Data format</h3>

<p>Each record (data.frame row or individual list element) you get via
<code>isd_parse</code> or <code>isd_parse_line</code> has all data combined.
Control data fields are first, then mandatory fields, then additional data
fields and remarks. Control and mandatory fields have column names
describing what they are, while additional data fields have a length
three character prefix (e.g., AA1) linking the fields to the documentation
for the <strong>Additional Data Section</strong> at
ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/ish-format-document.pdf
</p>


<h3>Data size</h3>

<p>Each line of an ISD data file has maximum of 2,844 characters.
</p>


<h3>Control Data</h3>

<p>The beginning of each record provides information about the report
including date, time, and station location information. Data fields
will be in positions identified in the applicable data definition.
The control data section is fixed length and is 60 characters long.
</p>


<h3>Mandatory data</h3>

<p>Each line of an ISD data file starts with mandatory data section.
The mandatory data section contains meteorological information on the
basic elements such as winds, visibility, and temperature. These are the
most commonly reported parameters and are available most of the time.
The mandatory data section is fixed length and is 45 characters long.
</p>


<h3>Additional data</h3>

<p>Each line of an ISD data file has an optional additional data
section, which follows the mandatory data section. These additional data
contain information of significance and/or which are received with
varying degrees of frequency. Identifiers are used to note when data
are present in the record. If all data fields in a group are missing,
the entire group is usually not reported. If no groups are reported
the section will be omitted. The additional data section is variable
in length with a minimum of 0 characters and a maximum of 637
(634 characters plus a 3 character section identifier) characters.
</p>


<h3>Remarks data</h3>

<p>The numeric and character (plain language) remarks are provided if they
exist. The data will vary in length and are identified in the applicable
data definition. The remarks section has a maximum length of 515
(512 characters plus a 3 character section identifier) characters.
</p>


<h3>Missing values</h3>

<p>Missing values for any non-signed item are filled (i.e., 999). Missing
values for any signed item are positive filled (i.e., +99999).
</p>


<h3>Longitude and Latitude Coordinates</h3>

<p>Longitudes will be reported with negative values representing longitudes
west of 0 degrees, and latitudes will be negative south of the equator.
Although the data field allows for values to a thousandth of a degree,
the values are often only computed to the hundredth of a degree with
a 0 entered in the thousandth position.
