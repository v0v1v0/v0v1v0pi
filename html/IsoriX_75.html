<p>This function fits the aggregated source data using mixed models. The fitting
procedures are done by the package <code>spaMM::spaMM</code> which we use to jointly fit
the mean isotopic values and their associated residual dispersion variance in
a spatially explicit manner.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The detailed statistical definition of the isoscape model is described in
Courtiol &amp; Rousset 2017 and summarized in Courtiol et al. 2019.
</p>
<p>Briefly, the fitting procedure of the isoscape model is divided into two
fits: <code>mean_fit</code> and <code>disp_fit</code>. <code>mean_fit</code> corresponds to the fit of the
"mean model", which we will use to predict the mean isotopic values at any
location in other functions of the package. <code>disp_fit</code> corresponds to the fit
of the "residual dispersion model", which we will use to predict the residual
dispersion variance associated to the mean predictions. <code>mean_fit</code> is a
linear mixed-effects model (LMM) with fixed effects, an optional spatial
random effect with a Matérn correlation structure and an optional
uncorrelated random effect accounting for variation between sources unrelated
to their location. <code>disp_fit</code> is a Gamma Generalized LMM (Gamma GLMM) that
also has fixed effects, an optional spatial random effect with a Matérn
correlation structure and an optional uncorrelated random effect. For the
GLMM the residual variance is fixed to its theoretical expectation.
</p>
<p>The <em>dataframe</em> <code>data</code> must contain a single row per source location with the
following columns: <code>mean_source_value</code> (the mean isotopic value),
<code>var_source_value</code> (the unbiased variance estimate of the isotopic value at
the location), <code>n_source_value</code> (the number of measurements performed at the
location, could be 1) and <code>source_ID</code> (a factor defining the identity of the
sources at a given location).
</p>
<p>The arguments <code>mean_model_fix</code> and <code>disp_model_fix</code> allow the user to choose
among different fixed-effect structures for each model. These arguments are
lists of booleans (<code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>), which define which of the following
fixed effects must be considered: the elevation (<code>elev</code>), the absolute value
of the latitude (<code>lat_abs</code>), the squared latitude (<code>lat_2</code>), the longitude
(<code>long</code>) and the squared longitude (<code>long_2</code>). An intercept is always
considered in both models.
</p>
<p>In the models, the mean (for the mean model) or the log residual variance
(for the residual dispersion model) follow a Gaussian distribution around a
constant value. The arguments <code>mean_model_rand</code> and <code>disp_model_rand</code> allow
to choose among different random effects for each model influencing the
realizations of these Gaussian random processes. For each model one can
choose not to include random effects or to include an uncorrelated random
effect, a spatial random effect, or both (default). Setting <code>"uncorr" = TRUE</code>
implies that the realizations of the random effect differ between sources for
reasons that have nothing to do with the relative geographic location (e.g.
some micro-climate or some measurement errors trigger a shift in all
measurements (mean model) or a shift in the variance between measurements
(residual dispersion model) performed at a given source by the same amount).
Setting <code>"spatial" = TRUE</code> (default) implies that the random realizations of
the Gaussian process follow a Matérn correlation structure. Put simply, this
implies that the closer two locations are, the more similar the means (or the
log residual variance) in isotopic values are (e.g. because they are likely
to be traversed by the same air masses).
</p>
<p>The arguments <code>uncorr_terms</code> allow the choice between two alternative
parametrizations for the uncorrelated random effect in the fits:
<code>"lambda"</code> or <code>"nugget"</code> for each model. When using
<code>"lambda"</code>, the variance of the uncorrelated random terms is classically
modelled by a variance. When a spatial random effect is considered, one can
alternatively choose <code>"nugget"</code>, which modifies the Matérn correlation
value when distance between location tends to zero. If no random effect is
considered, one should stick to the default setting and it will be ignored by
the function. The choice of the parametrization is a matter of personal
preferences and it does not change the underlying models, so the estimations
for all the other parameters of the models should not be impacted by whether
one chooses <code>"lambda"</code> or <code>"nugget"</code>. However, only uncertainty in
the estimation of <code>"lambda"</code> can be accounted for while computing
prediction variances, which is why we chose this alternative as the default.
Depending on the data one parametrization may lead to faster fit than the
other.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>spaMM_method</code> is also a list of two <em>strings</em> where the first
element defines the spaMM functions used for fitting the mean model and the
second element defines the spaMM method used for fitting the residual
dispersion model. The possible options are <code>"HLfit"</code>, <code>"corrHLfit"</code> and
<code>"fitme"</code>. Note that <code>"HLfit"</code> shall only be used in the absence of a Matérn
correlation structure and <code>"corrHLfit"</code> shall only be used in the presence of
it. In contrast, <code>"fitme"</code> should work in all situations. Which method is
best remains to be determined and it is good practice to try different
methods (if applicable) to check for the robustness of the results. If all is
well one should obtain very similar results with the different methods. If
this is not the case, carefully check the model output to see if one model
fit did not get stuck at a local minimum during optimization (which would
translate in a lower likelihood, or weird isoscapes looking flat with high
peaks at very localised locations).
</p>
<p>The argument <code>dist_method</code> allows modifying how the distance between
locations is computed to estimate the spatial correlation structure. By
default, we consider the so-called "Earth" distances which are technically
called orthodromic distances. They account for earth curvature. The
alternative "Euclidean" distances do not. For studies performed on a small
geographic scale, both distance methods should lead to similar results.
</p>
<p>The arguments <code>control_mean</code> and <code>control_dist</code> are lists that are
transmitted to the <code>spaMM::spaMM</code> fitting functions (defined by
<code>spaMM_method</code>). These lists can be used to finely control the fitting
procedure, so advanced knowledge of the package <code>spaMM::spaMM</code> is required
before messing around with these inputs.
</p>
<p>We highly recommend users to examine the output produced by isofit.
Sometimes, poor fit may occur and such models should therefore not be used
for building isoscapes or performing assignments.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns a <em>list</em> of class <em>ISOFIT</em> containing
two inter-related fits: <code>mean_fit</code> and <code>disp_fit</code>. The returned
<em>list</em> also contains the object <code>info_fit</code> that contains all the
call arguments.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>There is no reason to restrict <code>mean_fit</code> and <code>disp_fit</code> to
using the same parametrization for fixed and random effects.
</p>
<p>Never use a mean_fit object to draw predictions without considering a
disp_fit object: mean_fit is not fitted independently from disp_fit.
</p>
<p>For all methods, fixed effects are being estimated by Maximum Likelihood
(ML) and dispersion parameters (i.e. random effects and Matérn correlation
parameters) are estimated by Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML). Using
REML provides more accurate prediction intervals but impedes the accuracy
of Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRT). Our choice for REML was motivated by the
fact that our package is more likely to be used for drawing inferences than
null hypothesis testing. Users interested in model comparisons may rely on
the conditional AIC values that can be extracted from fitted models using
the function <code>spaMM::AIC</code> from  <span class="pkg">spaMM</span>.
</p>
<p>Variable names for <code>data</code> must be respected to ensure a correct utilization
of this package. Alteration to the fixed effect structure is not
implemented so far (beyond the different options proposed) to avoid misuse
of the package. Users that would require more flexibility should consider
using spaMM directly (see Courtiol &amp; Rousset 2017) or let us know which
other covariates would be useful to add in IsoriX.
