<h2>
Second-growth forests data (datatype = "incidence_raw" for taxonomic diversity)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset includes tree incidence data in 100 subplots (each with 0.01 ha) collected from two 
second-growth forests, namely Cuatro Rios (CR) and Juan Enriquez (JE) in Costa Rica.
Each 1-ha forest was divided into 100 subplots (each with 0.01 ha) and only species' incidence records 
in each subplot were used to compute the incidence frequency for a species 
(i.e., the number of subplots in which that species occurred); see Chazdon et al. (2021, 2022)
for sampling details and pertinent analyses. The original time series data covers 2005 to 2017; here only two-year data
(2005 and 2017) are used for assessing temporal beta diversity between the two years within each forest.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(Second_growth_forests)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Second_growth_forests is a list with two forests. The input format for each forests is a list with two species-by-sampling-units matrices ("Year_2005" and "Year_2017"). Each matrix record the species as 0 (undetect) or 1 (detect) in each sampling units. <br>
