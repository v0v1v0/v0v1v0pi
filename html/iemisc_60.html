<h2>Fraction (or Mixed number) to a Decimal (Numeric Vector)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Converts a fraction or a mixed number to a decimal
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">frac_to_numeric(n)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector that contains the fraction or mixed number (can
also include text, ex. inch, inches, etc. that will be removed from
the vector)</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the numeric <code>vector</code> as a decimal
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>If you have a measurement in feet + inches, then use <code>construction_fraction</code>
instead.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# Please refer to the iemisc: Construction Measurement Examples vignette for
# additional examples
 
# Example 1 -- Reference 1

library(iemisc)

xx &lt;- as.character(fractional::fractional(1:9 / 12))

try(frac_to_numeric(xx))
# Please note that there will be an error because this function is designed to
# only process one fraction at a time.

lapply(xx, frac_to_numeric)
# Please note that this is the correct way to work with several fractions at once.




# Example 2

library(iemisc)

xi &lt;- fracture::fracture((50:65) / 12)

try(frac_to_numeric(xi))
# Please note that there will be an error because this function is designed to
# only process one fraction at a time.

lapply(xi, frac_to_numeric)
# Please note that this is the correct way to work with several fractions at once.




# Example 3

library(iemisc)

xyy &lt;- fracture::fracture((1:11) / 12)

try(frac_to_numeric(xyy))
# Please note that there will be an error because this function is designed to
# only process one fraction at a time.

lapply(xyy, frac_to_numeric)
# Please note that this is the correct way to work with several fractions at once.



 
# Example 4

library(iemisc)

xft &lt;- as.character(MASS::fractions((1:70) / 12))

try(frac_to_numeric(xft))
# Please note that there will be an error because this function is designed to
# only process one fraction at a time.

lapply(xft, frac_to_numeric)
# Please note that this is the correct way to work with several fractions at once.



 
# Example 5

library(iemisc)

pix &lt;- "270/11"

pi1 &lt;- "22/7" # Reference 3

pi2 &lt;- "355/113" # Reference 3

frac_to_numeric(pix)

frac_to_numeric(pi1)

frac_to_numeric(pi2)



 
# Example 6

# If you have a construction measurement that includes a dimension in feet,
# such as 49 ft 7 5/8 in, don't use the frac_to_numeric function, instead
# use the construction_fraction function.

library(iemisc)

xxift &lt;- "49 ft 7 5/8 in"

construction_decimal(xxift, result = "traditional", output = "vector")




# Example 7 -- Reference 2

truss_marks &lt;- "19 3/16 inches"

frac_to_numeric(truss_marks)
