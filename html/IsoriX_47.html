<h2>Predicts the spatial distribution of source isotopic values</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function produces the set of isoscapes, i.e. the spatial prediction
(i.e. maps) of the distribution of source isotopic values, as well as several
variances around such predictions. The predictions are computed using the
fitted geostatistical models for each raster cell of a structural raster.
All shape files can be exported and loaded into any Geographic Information
System (GIS) if needed (see online tutorials).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">isoscape(raster, isofit, verbose = interactive())
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>raster</code></td>
<td>
<p>The structural raster (<em>SpatRaster</em>) such as an elevation
raster created using <code>prepelev</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>isofit</code></td>
<td>
<p>The fitted isoscape created by <code>isofit</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <em>logical</em> indicating whether information about the
progress of the procedure should be displayed or not while the function is
running. By default verbose is <code>TRUE</code> if users use an interactive R
session and <code>FALSE</code> otherwise.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function computes the predictions (<code>mean</code>), prediction variances
(<code>mean_predVar</code>), residual variances (<code>mean_residVar</code>) and response
variances (<code>mean_respVar</code>) for the isotopic values at a resolution equal
to the one of the structural raster. It also computes the same information
for the residual dispersion variance (<code>disp_pred</code>, <code>disp_predVar</code>,
<code>disp_residVar</code>, or <code>disp_respVar</code>).
</p>
<p>The predictions of isotopic values across the landscape are performed by
calling the function <code>spaMM::predict</code> from the package
<span class="pkg">spaMM</span> on the fitted isoscape produced by
<code>isofit</code>.
</p>
<p>Let us summarize the meaning of <code>mean</code>, <code>mean_predVar</code>,
<code>mean_residVar</code> and <code>mean_respVar</code> (see Courtiol &amp; Rousset 2017 and
Courtiol et al. 2019 for more details):
</p>
<p>Our model assumes that that there is a single true unknown isoscape, which is
fixed but which is represented by the mixed-effect model as a random draw
from possible realizations of isoscapes (random draws of the
Matérn-correlated process and of the uncorrelated random effects if
considered). We infer this realized isoscape by fitting the model to a
limited amount of data, with some uncertainty since different random draws of
the unknown isoscape may give the same observed data. There is thus a
conditional distribution of possible true isoscapes given the data. For
linear mixed-effects models, the mean prediction is the mean of this
conditional distribution. The prediction variance is ideally the mean square
difference between the true unknown value of the linear predictor and the
mean prediction at a given location. The residual variance is simply the
prediction of the variance in isotopic value at a given location. Its exact
meaning depends on the aggregation scheme used in <code>prepsources</code>,
but by default, it would correspond to the temporal variation between months
and across years. The response variance estimates the variance of new
observations drawn from the true unknown isoscape at a given location. The
response variance is simply equal to the sum of the prediction variance and
the residual variance (note that the residual variance considered assume that
a single observation is being observed per location).
</p>
<p>The isoscape can be plotted using the function <code>plot.ISOSCAPE</code>
(see examples).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns a <em>list</em> of class <em>ISOSCAPE</em> containing
a set of all 8 raster layers mentioned above (all being of class
<em>SpatRaster</em>), and the location of the sources as spatial points.
