<h2>Two-sided double-rank test for Fisher's sharp null
hypothesis in a cluster-level proportional treatment effect model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>double_rank</code> returns the two-sided p-value testing
Fisher's sharp null hypothesis in a cluster-level proportional
treatment effect model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">double_rank(beta_0, R_t, R_c, d_t, d_c, Z_t, Z_c, psi = NULL)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Double-rank test statistics is a flexible family of nonparametric
test statistics. Function <code>psi</code> is a function that specifies
the relationship between d_k, the normalized rank of the absolute
treated-minus-control dose difference in the instrumental variable,
and q_k, the normalized rank of the absoluve treated-minus-control
dose difference in the observed outcome. For instance, psi(d_k, q_k)
= 1 yields the sign test, psi(d_k, q_k) = q_k yields the Wilcoxon
signed rank test. The default setting, psi(d_k, q_k) = d_k * q_k, yields
the dose-weighted signed rank test.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of five elements: two-sided p-value, deviate, test statistics,
expectation of the test statistic under the null hypothesis,
and variance of the test statistic under the null hypothesis.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">R_t = encouraged_clusters$aggregated_outcome
R_c = control_clusters$aggregated_outcome
d_t = encouraged_clusters$aggregated_treatment
d_c = control_clusters$aggregated_treatment
Z_t = encouraged_clusters$IV
Z_c = control_clusters$IV


# Test beta = 0 in the proportional treatment effect
# model with the help of the double rank test using
# default psi(d_k, q_k) = d_k * q_k:
res = double_rank(0, R_t, R_c, d_t, d_c, Z_t, Z_c)

# Define a new psi function: psi(d_k, q_k) = q_k
psi_2 &lt;- function(x, y) y

# Using psi_2 and the double rank test is reduced to the
#Wilcoxon signed rank test.
res_2 = double_rank(0, R_t, R_c, d_t, d_c,
     Z_t, Z_c, psi = psi_2)
