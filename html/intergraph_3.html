<h2>Convert network to data frame(s)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Convert a network data object to, possibly two, data frames: a data frame
with an edge list with edge attributes (if any), and a data frame of vertexes
with vertex attributes (if any). This is a generic function, see below for
available methods.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">asDF(object, ...)

## S3 method for class 'network'
asDF(object, ...)

## S3 method for class 'igraph'
asDF(object, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>R object representing a network, see below for available
methods</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>other arguments passed to/from other methods</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Currently there are methods for <code>object</code> being in one of the following
classes: "network", "igraph".
</p>
<p>The function first gets the graph edge list using the appropriate function
depending on the class of <code>object</code> (see below).  Edge attributes, if
any, are then extracted using <code>dumpAttr</code> and added to it.
</p>
<p>The vertex data frame is constructed with a vertex id as a sequence of
integer numbers. Details are method-specific, see below.  Vertex attributes
are extracted with <code>dumpAttr</code> and added to this data frame.
</p>
<p>Method-specific notes:
</p>
<p>For objects of class "network". Objects of this class store the vertex ids
as integer numbers. There is also an attribute "vertex.names" which is
always created when using graph constructors provided in the package
<span class="pkg">network</span>.  <code>asDF</code> adds "vertex.names" to the vertex data frame as
a normal attribute and does not use it as a vertex id in the edge list.
</p>
<p>The edge list is created using <code>as.matrix.network</code>
function and contains integer vertex ids.
</p>
<p>Objects of class "igraph", as provided by the <span class="pkg">igraph</span> package. Vertex
ids in these objects integers starting from 1 (in <span class="pkg">igraph</span> version prior
to 0.6-0 vertex ids started from 0). However, it is also possible to provide
a vertex attribute "name". It is added to the vertex data frame as a normal
vertex attribute and is not used on the edge list data frame.
</p>
<p>The edge list is created using <code>get.edgelist</code> function
with argument <code>names</code> set to <code>FALSE</code> so that integer vertex ids
are used.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>List with two components:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>edges</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>containing an edge list data frame at first two columns
and edge attributes on further ones.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>vertexes</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>with vertex id in the first column, named <code>id</code>
and any vertex attributes in the other columns.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># using method for 'network' objects
d1 &lt;- asDF(exNetwork)
str(d1)

# using method for 'igraph' objects
d2 &lt;- asDF(exIgraph)
str(d2)
</code></pre>
