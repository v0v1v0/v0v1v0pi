<h2>Mean of Squares for Errors (MSE) under ANOVA Model 1A.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This MSE is associated with the one-factor ANOVA model where each subject could be rated by a different group of raters. This MSE is used
for calculating confidence intervals and p-values associated with the inter-rater reliability coefficient.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mse1a.fn(dfra)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dfra</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is a data frame containing 3 columns or more.  The first column contains subject numbers (there could be duplicates
if a subject was assigned multiple ratings) and each of the remaining columns is associated with a particular rater and contains its
numeric ratings.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns a vector containing the following 3 values:
1. mse: the MSE. 2. M: The total number of ratings from all raters and subjects. 3. n: The number of subjects that participated in the experiment.
