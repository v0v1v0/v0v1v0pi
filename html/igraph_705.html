<h2>Find Bonacich Power Centrality Scores of Network Positions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>power_centrality()</code> takes a graph (<code>dat</code>) and returns the Boncich power
centralities of positions (selected by <code>nodes</code>).  The decay rate for
power contributions is specified by <code>exponent</code> (1 by default).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">power_centrality(
  graph,
  nodes = V(graph),
  loops = FALSE,
  exponent = 1,
  rescale = FALSE,
  tol = 1e-07,
  sparse = TRUE
)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Bonacich's power centrality measure is defined by
<code class="reqn">C_{BP}\left(\alpha,\beta\right)=\alpha\left(\mathbf{I}-\beta\mathbf{A}\right)^{-1}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{1}</code>, where <code class="reqn">\beta</code> is an attenuation parameter (set
here by <code>exponent</code>) and <code class="reqn">\mathbf{A}</code> is the graph adjacency
matrix.  (The coefficient <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> acts as a scaling parameter,
and is set here (following Bonacich (1987)) such that the sum of squared
scores is equal to the number of vertices.  This allows 1 to be used as a
reference value for the “middle” of the centrality range.)  When
<code class="reqn">\beta \rightarrow </code><code class="reqn">
1/\lambda_{\mathbf{A}1}</code> (the reciprocal of the largest
eigenvalue of <code class="reqn">\mathbf{A}</code>), this is to within a constant multiple of
the familiar eigenvector centrality score; for other values of <code class="reqn">\beta</code>,
the behavior of the measure is quite different.  In particular, <code class="reqn">\beta</code>
gives positive and negative weight to even and odd walks, respectively, as
can be seen from the series expansion
<code class="reqn">C_{BP}\left(\alpha,\beta\right)=\alpha \sum_{k=0}^\infty \beta^k
</code><code class="reqn">
\mathbf{A}^{k+1} \mathbf{1}</code> which converges so long as <code class="reqn">|\beta|
</code><code class="reqn"> &lt; 1/\lambda_{\mathbf{A}1}</code>.
The magnitude of <code class="reqn">\beta</code> controls the influence of distant actors
on ego's centrality score, with larger magnitudes indicating slower rates of
decay.  (High rates, hence, imply a greater sensitivity to edge effects.)
</p>
<p>Interpretively, the Bonacich power measure corresponds to the notion that
the power of a vertex is recursively defined by the sum of the power of its
alters.  The nature of the recursion involved is then controlled by the
power exponent: positive values imply that vertices become more powerful as
their alters become more powerful (as occurs in cooperative relations),
while negative values imply that vertices become more powerful only as their
alters become <em>weaker</em> (as occurs in competitive or antagonistic
relations).  The magnitude of the exponent indicates the tendency of the
effect to decay across long walks; higher magnitudes imply slower decay.
One interesting feature of this measure is its relative instability to
changes in exponent magnitude (particularly in the negative case).  If your
theory motivates use of this measure, you should be very careful to choose a
decay parameter on a non-ad hoc basis.
</p>
<p>For directed networks, the Bonacich power measure can be understood as
similar to status in the network where higher status nodes have more edges
that point from them to others with status. Node A's centrality depends
on the centrality of all the nodes that A points toward, and their centrality
depends on the nodes they point toward, etc. Note, this means that a node
with an out-degree of 0 will have a Bonacich power centrality of 0 as they
do not point towards anyone. When using this with directed network it
is important to think about the edge direction and what it represents.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector, containing the centrality scores.
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>Singular adjacency matrices cause no end of headaches for
this algorithm; thus, the routine may fail in certain cases.  This will be
fixed when we get a better algorithm.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function was ported (i.e. copied) from the SNA package.
