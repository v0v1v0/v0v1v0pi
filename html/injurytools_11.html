<h2>Plot polar area diagrams representing players' prevalence</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Plot the proportions of available and injured players in the cohort, on a
monthly or season basis, by a polar area diagram. Further information on the
type of injury may be specified so that the injured players proportions are
disaggregated and reported according to this variable.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gg_injprev_polar(
  injd,
  by = c("monthly", "season"),
  var_type_injury = NULL,
  title = "Polar area diagram\ninjured and available (healthy) players"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>injd</code></td>
<td>
<p>Prepared data, an <code>injd</code> object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character, one of "monthly" or "season", specifying the periodicity
according to which to calculate the proportions of available and injured
players/athletes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var_type_injury</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character specifying the name of the column on the
basis of which to classify the injuries and calculate proportions of the
injured players. It should refer to a (categorical) variable that describes
the "type of injury". Defaults to <code>NULL</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>title</code></td>
<td>
<p>Text for the main title.</p>
