Ciliates data (datatype = "incidence_raw") 
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A total of 51 soil samples were taken from three areas ( <code>EtoshaPan</code>, <code>CentralNamibDesert</code>, <code>SouthernNamibDesert</code>) of Namibia. In area <code>EtoshaPan</code>, there were 19 soil samples and the number of observed species was 216. In area <code>CentralNamibDesert</code>, there were 17 soil samples and the number of observed species was 130. In area <code>SouthernNamibDesert</code>, there were 15 soil samples and the number of observed species was 150. The total number of species in the three areas was 365. The data include three lists of matrices; each matrix is a species by soil-sample matrix ("1" for a detection, and "0" otherwise).  
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("ciliates")</code></pre>
