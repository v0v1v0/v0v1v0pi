<h2>Tartar for dogs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dog experiment was carried out in order to examine the effect of two
treatments on the development of tartar.
Apart from the two treatment groups there was also a control group.  Twenty-six dogs
were used and allocated to one of the three groups.
After four weeks each dog was examined,
and the development of tartar was summarized by an index.
