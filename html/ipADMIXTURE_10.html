<h2>A list of Q matrices of simulation of 20 populations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing admixture ratios of 1200 individuals from 20 simulation populations where the number of ancestors ranges from 2 to 18.
This dataset was the result of running LEA library developed by Frichot, E., &amp; Fran√ßois, O. (2015). LEA: An R package for landscape and ecological association studies. Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 6(8), 925-929.
