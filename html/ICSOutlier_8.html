<h2>
Production Measurements of High-Tech Parts - Full Rank Case
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>HTP</code> data set contains 902 high-tech parts designed for consumer products characterized by 88 tests. These tests are performed to ensure a high quality 
of the production. All these 902 parts were considered functional and have been sold.  However the two parts 581 and 619 
showed defects in use and were returned to the manufacturer by the customer. Therefore these two can be considered as outliers.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("HTP")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 902 observations and 88 numeric variables V.1 - V.88.
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>Anonymized data from a nondisclosed manufacturer.
