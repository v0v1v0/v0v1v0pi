<h2>Assess overlap from one set of intervals to another</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Assess overlap from intervals in one set to intervals in another set,
and return the relevant indices.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S4 method for signature 
## 'Intervals_virtual_or_numeric,Intervals_virtual_or_numeric'
interval_overlap(from, to, check_valid = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>from</code></td>
<td>

<p>An <code>"Intervals"</code> or <code>"Intervals_full"</code> object, or a
vector of class <code>"numeric"</code>. <em>Note!</em> Prior to v. 0.11.1,
this argument was called <code>target</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>to</code></td>
<td>

<p>An <code>"Intervals"</code> or <code>"Intervals_full"</code> object, or a
vector of class <code>"numeric"</code>. <em>Note!</em> Prior to v. 0.11.1,
this argument was called <code>query</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>check_valid</code></td>
<td>

<p>Should <code>validObject</code> be called before passing to
compiled code? This, among other things, verifies that endpoints are
of data type <code>"numeric"</code> and the <code>closed</code> vector/matrix is
appropriately sized and of the correct data type. (Compiled code
does no further checking.)
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Intervals which meet at endpoints overlap only if both endpoints are
closed. Intervals in <code>to</code> with <code>NA</code> endpoints are
ignored, with a warning; in <code>from</code>, such intervals produce no
matches. Intervals in either <code>to</code> or <code>from</code> which are
actually empty have their endpoints set to <code>NA</code> before
proceeding, with warning, and so do not generate matches. If
eith <code>to</code> or <code>from</code> is a vector of class <code>"numeric"</code>,
overlap will be assess for the corresponding set of points.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list, with one element for each row/component of <code>from</code>. The
elements are vectors of indices, indicating which <code>to</code> rows (or
components, for the <code>"numeric"</code> method) overlap each interval in
<code>from</code>. A list element of length 0 indicates no overlapping
elements.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>If you want real (<code>type == "R"</code>) intervals that overlap in a set
of positive measure — not just at endpoints — set all endpoints to
open (i.e., <code>close(from) &lt;- FALSE; closed(to) &lt;- FALSE</code>) first.
</p>
<p>This function is now just a wrapper for <code>which_nearest</code>.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>See <code>which_nearest</code> for details on nearby as well as
overlapping intervals in <code>to</code>.
