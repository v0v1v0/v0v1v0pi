<h2>Dataset mtcars without row names</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In the <code>mtcars</code> dataset, the names of the car models are
stored as row names. However, when working with <code>ggplot2</code> and other
packages from the <code>tidyverse</code>, it is convenient to have all data in columns.
<code>mtcars2</code> is a variant of <code>mtcars</code> that contains car models in a column
instead of storing them as row names.
<code>mtcars_na</code> is the same dataset as <code>mtcars2</code>, but some of the columns
contain missing values.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mtcars2

mtcars2_na
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 32 rows and 12 variables. The format is identical
to <code>mtcars</code> and details can be found in its documentation. The only
difference is that the car model names are stored in the column <code>model</code>
instead of the row names.
