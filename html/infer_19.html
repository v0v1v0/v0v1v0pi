<h2>Subset of data from the General Social Survey (GSS).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The General Social Survey is a high-quality survey which gathers data on
American society and opinions, conducted since 1972. This data set is a
sample of 500 entries from the GSS, spanning years 1973-2018,
including demographic markers and some
economic variables. Note that this data is included for demonstration only,
and should not be assumed to provide accurate estimates relating to the GSS.
However, due to the high quality of the GSS, the unweighted data will
approximate the weighted data in some analyses.
