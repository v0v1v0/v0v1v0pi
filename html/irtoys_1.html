<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>irtoys</code> package contains a bunch of functions potentially useful
to those teaching or learning Item Response Theory (IRT). R being 
particularly good at graphics, there is a rich array of plotting 
functions to visualize IRT models or assess their fit. Ability estimates 
can be estimated by MLE, BME, EAP, WLE. Various IRT scaling methods are supported: 
MM, MS, Stocking-Lord, and Hebaera. Last not least, <code>irtoys</code> may be
the only package to estimate Haberman's interaction model, although a new and
more powerful package is in the making.
</p>
<p>Currently, there are several R packages that can estimate the item parameters
in various uni- and multidimensional IRT models, but only several years ago one
had to use stand-alone programs that had wildly different and
often unwieldy user interfaces. Besides, no single program does everything
one needs. One of the original purposes of <code>irtoys</code> was to provide a 
simple and unified interface to some of the most basic
functions in ICL, BILOG, and R's own <code>ltm</code>, such that beginners could
concentrate on learning IRT rather than syntaxes. Once that these steps 
have been made, those wishing to take
advantage of the full functionality of ICL, BILOG &amp; Co. must still master
the syntax of their program of choice.
</p>
<p>To take full advantage of <code>irtoys</code>, some IRT software is needed.
Package <code>ltm</code> is automatically loaded.  ICL by Brad Hanson can be
downloaded from his site, <a href="http://www.openirt.com/b-a-h/software/">http://www.openirt.com/b-a-h/software/</a>.
Executables and a very detailed manual (not needed to use ICL with 
<code>irtoys</code> are provided for Windows, Linux, and Macintosh. The Mac
version probably does not work with the current OS versions but I still
use the Windows and Linux versions without any problem.
</p>
<p>BILOG is commercial software sold by SSI â€”
see <a href="https://ssicentral.com/">https://ssicentral.com/</a> for further detail.
</p>
<p>On Windows, make sure that the executable files (<code>icl.exe</code> for ICL,
<code>BLM1.EXE</code>, <code>BLM2.EXE</code>, and <code>BLM3.EXE</code> for BILOG) are located
in a directory that is included in the PATH variable.  On Linux, BILOG,
being a Windows program, is run with <code>wine</code>, and should also be on a
path where wine can find it.  On my machine, I have simply put the three
files in <code>~/.wine/drive_c/windows/</code>. It seems that new versions of wine
expect them to be explicitly tagged as executable. On Macintosh, at least
<code>ltm</code> should work in all cases.
</p>
<p>NOTE: Starting with version 0.2.0, function <code>est</code> returns a list of three
elements: <code>est</code> contains the parameter estimates and is thus identical
to the output in earlier versions, <code>se</code> contains the standard errors,
in a similar format, and <code>vcm</code> contains the variance-covariance matrices
(NULL when using ICL). When passing item parameters to another function that
only needs the estimates, <code>irf(ip)</code> and 
<code>irf(ip$est)</code> can be used interchangeably. This facilitates using simulated
item parameters. A function that does require the complete object is . 
</p>
<p>Also, function <code>itf</code> now returns item fit statistics 
as a vector rather than a list. Finally, since most of the functions in <code>irtoys</code>
have been written with the "logistic" metric in mind (i.e., <code class="reqn">a_j(\theta_i-b_j)</code>
rather than <code class="reqn">1.7a^*_j(\theta_i-b_j)</code>, function <code>est</code> now estimates item 
parameters only in the logistic metric.
