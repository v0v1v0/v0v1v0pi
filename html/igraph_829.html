<h2>All isomorphic mappings between a graph and subgraphs of another graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>All isomorphic mappings between a graph and subgraphs of another graph
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pattern</code></td>
<td>
<p>The smaller graph, it might be directed or
undirected. Undirected graphs are treated as directed graphs with
mutual edges.</p>

<p>The bigger graph, it might be directed or
undirected. Undirected graphs are treated as directed graphs with
mutual edges.</p>

<p>The method to use. Possible values: ‘auto’,
‘lad’, ‘vf2’. See their details below.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of vertex sequences, corresponding to all
mappings from the first graph to the second.
</p>


<h3>‘lad’ method</h3>

<p>This is the LAD algorithm by Solnon, see the reference below. It has
the following extra arguments:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>domains</dt>
<dd>
<p>If not <code>NULL</code>, then it specifies matching
restrictions. It must be a list of <code>target</code> vertex sets, given
as numeric vertex ids or symbolic vertex names. The length of the
list must be <code>vcount(pattern)</code> and for each vertex in
<code>pattern</code> it gives the allowed matching vertices in
<code>target</code>. Defaults to <code>NULL</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>induced</dt>
<dd>
<p>Logical scalar, whether to search for an induced
subgraph. It is <code>FALSE</code> by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>time.limit</dt>
<dd>
<p>The processor time limit for the computation, in
seconds. It defaults to <code>Inf</code>, which means no limit.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>‘vf2’ method</h3>

<p>This method uses the VF2 algorithm by Cordella, Foggia et al., see
references below. It supports vertex and edge colors and have the
following extra arguments:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>vertex.color1, vertex.color2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Optional integer vectors giving the
colors of the vertices for colored graph isomorphism. If they
are not given, but the graph has a “color” vertex attribute,
then it will be used. If you want to ignore these attributes, then
supply <code>NULL</code> for both of these arguments. See also examples
below.</p>
</dd>
<dt>edge.color1, edge.color2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Optional integer vectors giving the
colors of the edges for edge-colored (sub)graph isomorphism. If they
are not given, but the graph has a “color” edge attribute,
then it will be used. If you want to ignore these attributes, then
supply <code>NULL</code> for both of these arguments.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
