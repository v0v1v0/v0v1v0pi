<h2>Data from GSZ (2016): Subsample</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2016); southern Italian cities
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 2175 rows and 11 columns.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The authors revisit Putnam, Leonardi, and Nanetti (1992)’s celebrated conjecture that Italian cities that achieved self-government in the Middle Ages have higher modern-day levels of social capital. More specifically, they study the effects of free city-state status on social capital as measured by the number of nonprofit organizations and organ donations per capita, and a measure of whether students cheat in mathematics. We focus on the first outcome, the number of nonprofit organizations. 
</p>
<p>This dataset is a subsample of southern Italian cities, which is used as a zero-first-stage sample.
