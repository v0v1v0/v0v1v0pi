<h2>Idaho National Laboratory Facilities</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Federal research facilities at the Idaho National Laboratory (<a href="https://inl.gov/">INL</a>).
The INL facilities have been the primary source of radioactive and
chemical waste constituents in the water from the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer
and in perched groundwater zones at or near the INL.
This is due to the wastewater disposal practices at the INL facilities.
