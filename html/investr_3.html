<h2>Bladder volume data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A series of 23 women patients attending a urodynamic clinic were recruited 
for a study. After successful voiding of the bladder, sterile water was 
introduced in additions of 10, 15, and then 25 ml increments up to a final 
cumulative total of 175 ml. At each volume a measure of height (H) in mm and 
depth (D) in mm of largest ultrasound bladder images were taken. The product 
H × D was taken as a measure of liquid volume.
