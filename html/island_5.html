<h2>Lakshadweep Archipelago coral fish community reassembly</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A list with three datasets containing presence-absence data for the
reassembly proccess of coral fish communities in three atolls (Agatti, Kadmat
and Kavaratti) of the Lakshadweep Archipelago (India).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with 3 dataframes, each corresponding to the survey of a
different atoll. Dataframes have in columns: </p>
 <dl>
<dt>Species</dt>
<dd>
<p>Name
of the species found</p>
</dd> <dt>Trophic.Level</dt>
<dd>
<p>A number indicating the trophic
level of the surveyed species</p>
</dd> <dt>Presence-absence data</dt>
<dd>
<p>Several columns
with letters (indicating the atoll surveyed) and the year in which the
surveys were done</p>
</dd> <dt>Guild</dt>
<dd>
<p>Guild of the surveyed species</p>
</dd> </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Surveys were conducted from 2000 to 2011 in order to follow community
reassembly after a coral mass mortality event in the relatively unfished
Lakshadweep Archipelago.  Results indicated that higher trophic groups suffer
an increased extinction rate even without fishing targeting them.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Kavaratti atoll was not surveyed in 2000 and 2010.
