Pr(abortion-related death | i310 = 1) = "N"
(the previous values were "E").

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 354 observations on 87 variables. The first row contains
observations corresponding to prior probabilities; while the subsequent observations
(rows 2 - 354) are the conditional probabilities.
