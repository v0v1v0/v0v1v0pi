<h2>Quality of soap</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The electric conductance was measured for 32 pieces of soap in 4 groups (8 pieces in each group). The content of fatty acid differs between the groups. Quality of soap is mainly determined by its content of fatty acid, which can be determined with a chemical analysis. It is much easier to measure the electric conductance, and it is therefore of interest if there is a simple relation between the two.</p>
