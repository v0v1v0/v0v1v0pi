<h2>Display Economic Preferences for ICE Outcomes within a Bootstrap Confidence Wedge</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Assuming x is an object of class ICEcolor, the default invocation of plot(x)
first displays a Histogram depicting the Distribution of Economic Preferences within an
ICE Confidence Wedge then applies a rainbow of colors to these same points on a display
of the ICE Bootstrap re-sampling Scatter. An invocation of the form plot(x, alibi=TRUE)
uses alibi (rather than alias) scaling when displaying the Bootstrap Scatter plot. When
ready, the user should press the ENTER Key to overwrite the Histogram display with the
Scatter plot.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  ## S3 method for class 'ICEcolor'
plot(x, alibi = FALSE, show = "Both", ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Required; Output list object of class ICEcolor.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alibi</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional; Logical value of TRUE or FALSE to control scaling of axes. alibi
= FALSE produces the default alias graphic in which points in the bootstrap uncertainty
scatter are held fixed in space, and changes in lambda change the scaling (tick marks)
along either the horizontal axis of a cost unit display or else along the vertical axis
of an effe unit display.  alibi = TRUE produces an alibi graphic in which the scaling
(and range) is the same along both axes, and changes in lambda cause the points in the
bootstrap uncertainty scatter to move either left or right in a cost unit display or else
up or down in an effe unit display.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>show</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional; Character string of "Hist", "RBOW" or "Both". show = "Hist" displays 
a Histogram depicting the distribution of Economic Preferences within the ICE Wedge, while
show = "RBOW" applies a rainbow of colors (Red–Tan–Yellow–Green) to depict the Economic
Preference level associated with each re-sampled point within the ICE Wedge. show = "Both"
is the default; it requires the user to press the ENTER key when ready to overwrite the 
initial "Hist" display with the corresponding "RBOW" plot.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional; Argument(s) passed on to plot().</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To illustrate the sensitivity of Economic Preferences to choice of lambda, multiple calls are 
usually made to ICEcolor() for different values of lambda as well as for different choices of
the beta and gamma parameters that determine the shape of (and spacing between) Indifference
Curves on an ICE Economic Preference Map.
</p>
<p>The plot() of an object of class ICEcolor displays the Bootstrap Distribution of ICE Uncertainty
using small, circular, colored dots (pch = 20).  Outcomes outside the Confidence Wedge are
displayed in black, while outcomes inside the Wedge are displayed in a rainbow of colors (within
the Red–Tan–Yellow–Green range) that represent Economic Preferences.
</p>
<p>Upper and lower ICE Confidence Limits are again displayed as Solid black Rays. The Dashed black
LINE trough the ICE Origin, (0,0), has slope 1, indicating the ZERO Preference boundary that
literally bisects the North-East and South-West ICE Quadrants. This Dashed Line may not "appear"
to have slope 1, but that happens only when the horizontal and vertical RANGES displayed are
quite different.
