<h2>Concrete Mix Design for Structural Lightweight Concrete</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the amount of cement, sand, gravel, and water needed for a test
batch volume of structural lightweight concrete using the weight method.
Note: Currently, this function only works with air-entrained concrete as the
author has not found a table to compute the weight of concrete for nonair-
entrained concrete.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

  slump_use = NULL,
  max_size_aggr,

  absorp_fine,
  entrainment = c("Nonair", "Air"),
