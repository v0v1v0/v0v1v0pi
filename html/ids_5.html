<h2>Generate random proquint identifiers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generate random "proquint" identifiers.  "proquint" stands for
PRO-nouncable QUINT-uplets and were described by Daniel Wilkerson
in <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/0901.4016">https://arxiv.org/html/0901.4016</a>.  Each "word" takes one
of <code class="reqn">2^16</code> possibilities.  A four word proquint has a keyspace
of <code class="reqn">10^19</code> possibilities but takes only 23 characters.
Proquint identifiers can be interchanged with integers (though
this is totally optional); see <code>proquint_to_int</code> and
the other functions documented on that page.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">proquint(n = 1, n_words = 2L, use_cache = TRUE, use_openssl = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of ids to return.  If <code>NULL</code>, it instead
returns the generating function</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n_words</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of words for each identifier; each word
has <code>2^16</code> (65536) possible combinations, a two-word
proquint has <code>2^32</code> possible combinations and an
<code>k</code>-word proquint has <code>2^(k * 16)</code> possible
combinations.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>use_cache</code></td>
<td>
<p>Because there are relatively few combinations per
word, and because constructing short strings is relatively
expensive in R, it may be useful to cache all 65536 possible
words.  If <code>TRUE</code> then the first time that this function is
used all words will be cached and the results used - the first
time may take up to ~1/4 of a second and subsequent calls will
be much faster.  The identifiers selected will not change with
this option (i.e., given a particular random seed, changing this
option will not affect the identifiers randomly selected).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>use_openssl</code></td>
<td>
<p>Use openssl for random number generation, with
the primary effect that the identifiers will not be affected by
R's random seed (at a small speed cost).</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the abstract of their paper, Wilkerson introduces proquints:
</p>
<p>"Identifiers (IDs) are pervasive throughout our modern
life. We suggest that these IDs would be easier to manage and
remember if they were easily readable, spellable, and
pronounceable. As a solution to this problem we propose using
PRO-nouncable QUINT-uplets of alternating unambiguous consonants
and vowels: proquints."

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># A single, two word, proquint
proquint()

# Longer identifier:
proquint(n_words = 5)

# More identifiers
proquint(10)
</code></pre>
